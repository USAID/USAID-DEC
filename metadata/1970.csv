169275,"Grant is provided to improve Government of Paraguay's (GOP) public administration.  Project consists of four subprojects. Subproject two will improve GOP's compilation and dissemination of official statistics. Advisors from the U.S. Census Bureau will implement the project, and GOP will contribute financial support. Inputs provided for a related USAID/GOP Census and Household Survey Project (526008502) will eventually be available for activities under the present project. The first major output will be the establishment of a workable coordinating mechanism for all official GOP statistics. A policymaking National Council, representing the users of statistics, and a number of Technical Sector Committees, made up of the producers of statistics, will jointly prepare and implement plans for the development of the national statistical system. Specific targets will include:  (1) organization and implementation of a coordinated training program to provide instruction in general statistical methods and techniques to GOP personnel; (2) establishment of coordinated data processing and printing facilities, utilizing, as far as possible, computers available outside the statistical system; (3) establishment of a central data file incorporating all statistics of general interest to development planners; and (4) implementation of a coordinated program to publish economic and social statistical data in a timely manner.  The second major output will involve improving the Directorate General of Statistics and Census (DGEC) to the point where it will be capable of exercising effective leadership of the national statistical system and of providing needed technical services to other GOP statistics units. The major step to be taken here will be the implementation of the 1942 statistics law.  The final output will be the development, in component units of the national statistical system that do not benefit from separate assistance projects, of a capability to carry out their share of the national program as defined by the Council and Sector Committees. First subproject revision (PD-AAC-786-A1), dated 8/13/73, scales down some of the original subproject outputs due to a conflict in allocating DGEC resources for this subproject and for the population census project (526008502).  The target activities for the council and sector committees will be planned and only partially implemented, as DGEC resources and GOP budget considerations permit. The UN, the Organization of American States, the Pan-American Health Organization, and possibly other donors will also assist in upgrading GOP statistical units outside of the DGEC.",,,,"MULLER, HANS J.",,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,6/8/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,17 Aug 1970,1970-08,,,,,,Institution building|Indigenous education|Participants|Technical publications|Statistical data|Information storage and retrieval systems|Management information systems|Computers|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Statistical analysis|Technical training,,Paraguay,,PD-AAC-785-B1,,,,,False,F|E,,815 KB,PDF,,526,Paraguay,,,008590,USAID.

156970,"This study attempted to obtain insights into the role of food marketing in economic development. A pilot undertaking, the study served as a training activity for a research team that later conducted further studies in other Latin American communities. The objectives of the study were to measure and analyze changes in Puerto Rican food marketing system from 1950 to 1965, recommend further improvements, develop research methods useful for appraising systems in other Latin American countries, and draw inferences about the role of food marketing in economic development. Sections of the report deal with applicable economic and marketing theory; an overview of the Puerto Rican economy; efforts to improve the food marketing system; changes in the urban consumer; changes in food retailing and wholesaling; the vertical coordination of production-distribution systems for eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables; modernization and innovation in the Puerto Rican food system; discussion of a marketing systems model; and a summary and conclusions concerning changes in the Puerto Rican system and implications for other countries. During the fifteen-year period of rapid economic and social change from 1950 to 1965, consumers improved their diets by shifting away from starchy foods toward more high-protein foods (meat, milk, eggs) and certain fruits and vegetables. At the same time the percentage of income spent for food by the average family declined from 42.5% in 1953 to 32.8% in 1963. In 1950 most of the food was retailed through small colmado-type stores carrying relatively few products and operating on relatively wide margins. Plaza markets and specialized food stores handled most of the perishable foods. Wholesaling was also small scale and high cost. Credit was an important aspect of the wholesale-retail system and added to the final cost to consumers. By 1965, approximately 40% of the retail food sales in the San Juan area were made through modern supermarkets, and much of the remaining food sales were made through smaller but relatively modern neighborhood food stores. These changes in the food distribution system were encouraged and assisted by public efforts. Direct public investments were made in a wholesale food marketing facility in the San Juan port area, several plaza-type markets in urban centers, and a livestock slaughtering and meat processing plant. The government also conducted a feasibility study and helped arrange the land purchase and financing of modern grain-handling facilities in the San Juan port area. Efforts to improve the food distribution system included training, direct technical assistance, and credit incentives to food marketing firms; new regulations to improve market coordination and to protect the interests of consumers; and public programs to provide marketing information and services that would not likely be provided by private enterprises.",,,4:3,,,54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,AID/CSD-786,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Consumers|Economic aspects|Food industry|Supply,,Puerto Rico,,PN-AAC-251,,,,,True,F|E,,"13,095 KB",PDF,,004,Puerto Rico,,,000783,Michigan State University.

156971,"The primary objective of this study was to conduct diagnostic studies of market coordination in the Cauca Valley region and to make recommendations for improving resource use efficiency and stimulate economic growth. Secondary objectives were to train Colombian personnel in the technical aspects of economic studies and to contribute to their better understanding of market coordination processes in economic development. Sections of the report deal with the market coordination problems and institutional environment of the Cauca Valley and the city of Cali, the Cali urban food distribution system, the production and distribution of selected foods in the Cali area (meat, poultry, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables, grains), special industries in the food system, consumer goods in the industrial transition, some public aspects of market coordination of the food system, a summary diagnosis of problems (including some barriers to change), and recommendations concerning desirable changes and timing of their implementation. The study showed that it is possible to carry out a market improvement program in Cali that could reduce urban food distribution costs by 20 to 25 percent, while at the same time substantially improving services to consumers, especially those in the lower income areas. The details of how this could be done are discussed.",,,4:3,,,54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,AID/CSD-786,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Coordinating|Food industry|Supply,,Colombia,,PN-AAC-252,,,,,True,F|E,,"18,966 KB",PDF,,514,Colombia,,,000783,Michigan State University.

THE SECONDARY TARGET GROUP CONSISTS OF ADULT PRODUCTION WORKERS WHOSE CALORIC INTAKE IS A FACTOR LIMITING PRODUCTIVITY. OPTIMAL NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS REQUIRE SPECIFIC NATIONAL NUTRITION POLICIES AND AN EFFECTIVE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THESE ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF A MODEL THAT DESCRIBES THE SOURCES, FUNCTIONING, AND EFFECTS OF PROGRAMS. GENERAL REQUISITES FOR A SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL PROGRAM INCLUDE A MINIMUM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUTLAY, POLITICAL ACCEPTANCE, TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION, AND CONTINUING EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAMS. THE MODEL IS DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF ITS APPLICATION TO TWO ONGOING NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THE FIRST IS THE WHEAT ATTA FORTIFICATION PROGRAM INITIATED IN 1970 IN BOMBAY. THE SECOND IS THE CHILD FEEDING PROGRAM OPERATED BY THE BOMBAY MUNICIPAL CORPORATION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CARE. THESE REPRESENT TWO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO A SINGLE TARGET POPULACE. SOME 24 ASPECTS AND EFFECTS OF THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE COMPARED AND DISCUSSED. THE AUTHORS CAUTION THAT THE DATA PRESENTED ARE A SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL APPLICATION OF THE MODEL, SINCE THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT OF OTHER NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IN INDIA.

THE CLONE SEEMS VERY WELL ADAPTED TO ALL SOIL CONDITIONS FROM AA LAVA TO THE VERY CLAYEY HYDROHUMIC LATOSOLS FOUND IN THE HIGH-RAINFALL AREA. IT IS NOW BEING USED UP TO AN ELEVATION OF AT LEAST 2700 FEET, BUT THERE IS NO REASON NOW TO SUPPOSE THIS IS THE MAXIMUM ELEVATION AT WHICH IT WILL THRIVE. WITH REASONABLE CARE THE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE SACCHARUM CLONE DOES NOT EXCEED 12 FEET WITH THE CANEY PORTIONS NOT MUCH MORE THAN 6 TO 8 FEET HIGH. UNDER EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD MANAGEMENT, OVERALL HEIGHT OF THE CANES CAN EXCEED 20 FEET CAUSING THE CANES TO LODGE AND TO OCCUPY SPACE NEEDED BY THE CASH CROPS BEING PROTECTED.",,,4:3,"Schigeura, G.

156592,"This report proposes the use of a rating system for field surveys, based on the extent of stem browning as a measure of disease severity. To test the method, soybean fields were surveyed for the incidence and severity of brown stem rot in the east central region of Illinois in September of 1968 and 1969.  On the basis of a three-point rating system, plants rated in the third class yielded significantly less than plants in the first and second classes.  This is the first case where a rating system has been used to reflect yield of soybeans infected with C.  gregatum.  The system is simple, can be used at a timely period in the growth cycle, and is effective over a variety of conditions.  In view of evidence that this disease is spreading over vast acreages of the soybean crop, this method of surveying damage might be useful for workers in several states where an analysis of severity is needed.",,,4:2,"Gray, L.

156593,"Five fungicides known to be systemic in plants other than soybean were found to be fungitoxic to four soybean pathogens:  Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora, D. phaseolorum var. sojae, Cercospora kikuchii, and Cepholosporium gregatum in vitro. The fungicides were benomyl, chloroneb, DCMOD, DMOC, and TBZ.  TBZ was evaluated against only D. phaseolorum var. sojae, and not against the other three pathogens.  Some fungitoxic component of benomyl, chrononeb, and TBZ moved systematically in soybean seedlings after seedling roots were exposed to the chemicals.  It was not ascertained whether the specific fungicide or a compound related to it accounted for fungitoxicity in treated seedling tissues.  DCMOD and DMOC were phytotoxic at the levels tested, and could not be bioassayed for systemic activity.  Benomyl and TBZ tended to accumulate in the cotyledons of treated seedlings, but not in the hypocotyl tissues.

THE MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT BENOMYL, OR A COMPOUND RELATED TO IT, BECOMES LOCALIZED IN THE COTYLEDONS. BENOMYL REMAINED ACTIVE IN HYPOCOTYL TISSUE FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND THUS OFFERED ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION TO SOYBEAN SEEDLINGS.

156610,"The methods and results of a study of the nutritional effects on albino rats of diets of low-or high-protein milled factions from two sorghum-grain hybrids of equal protein content were milled with conventional dry-milling equipment.  The protein content of the endosperm fractions ranged from 6.82 to 15.9%.  The fat, fiber, and ash contents of all fractions were about 1.0, 1.0, and 0.5% respectively. Amino acid composition of the fractions varied. On the basis of essential amino acid contents, the nutritional quality of low-protein fractions was superior to that of high-protein fractions. Nutritive value of milled products of low- and high-protein content from each hybrid was compared on the basis of growth and protein efficiency ratios (PER's) of rats, with casein control diets used. Each fraction was fed with and without lysine and methionine supplements. When diets were not supplemented with lysine and methionine, the low-protein endosperm fraction. However, when the low- and high-protein fractions were supplemented with amino acids to meet calculated requirements, differences were not found, indicating that protein was utilized similarly when deficient amino acids to meet calculated requirements, differences were not found, indicating that protein Amino acid supplementation of diets caused a marked increase in weight gain of rats, and PER's were similar to those obtained with casein.

156627,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">A study of the role of agriculture in the economic development of Guatemala, which suggests short- and medium-term policies conductive to economic development. The analysis is based on the assumption that no major land reform program could occur during the early 1970s. The nine chapters of this book discuss Guatemalan geography and population: structure and performance of the Guatemalan economy: the role of agriculture in the economy: structure of the agricultural sector: supply and demand projections for basic foods: government policies and programs: improving grain marketing, marketing of basic foods: and alternative policies and programs. Among the conclusions and recommendations in the last chapter are the following: The Guatemalan government should give the highest priority to improving the productivity of land and labor resources in the agricultural sector. Programs designed to achieve this goal should emphasize increases in rural employment and improvements in income distribution as well as increased output. Producing more perhectare and more per man is the best way to reconcile the apparent conflict between output and welfare goals. The wages and housing of resident and migratory workers on large commercial farms need to be upgraded to the level of urban industrial workers. Raising yields per hectare on small farms is the best way to overcome growing underemployment and raise rural levels of living for small farmers. Programs of family planning need to be implemented as soon as possible. A major roadbuilding and improvement program should initiated in the rural areas. Higher-yeilding varities of corn should be introduced with seed and fertilizer distributed directly to farmers as creditin-kind. Locally adapted, production-oriented research on means of improving corn and bean production should be initiated. The government program designed for sending qualified students abroad for graduate training in agricultural development should be expanded. Government programs in the Departments of Agriculture and Economics should be provided with sufficient funds and personnel to produce more reliable and complete statistical data on agricultural production, so that existing production and marketing programs can be better identified, and the effects of new developmental programs assessed.</span>",'Report of a study arranged by the Guatemalan Mission of the U.S. Agency for International Development.',,4:2,"Fletcher, Lehman B.|Graber, Eric S.|et al.",,51,M,Assessment,,,,AID/csd-2824,,,,12/2/1982 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Economic analysis|Government policy,,Guatemala,,PN-AAB-896,,--JH,,,True,F|E,,"9,629 KB",PDF,,520,Guatemala,,,001483,Iowa State University of Science and Technology,A,DST/W-588,,,English,application/pdf,D79.3|J02.57.G|G06.27.8,,3,223,,,,,,,,3974,,,,,,FROM RANDD|Converted to searchable PDF 2011-03-15 (exact OCR),AE00,Guatemala's economic development : the role of agriculture,,,,,,3974PN-AAB-896,,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PNAAB896.pdf,001483 - Iowa State University of Science and Technology,008550 - USAID.

Sections of the paper deal with such questions as the distinction between agricultural and rural development, whether an agricultural development project can best be con- sidered a system or a subsystem, and whether it is more impor- tant for development activities to be integrated as opposed to simultaneously available.  Next presented are a classification system and a discussion of six major types of integrated develop- ment projects, each containing a different combination of ele- ments, but all possessing two common characteistics:  limitation to a specific land area, and limitation to elements not already present but potentially effective in the project area. Next fol- lows a discussion of the importance of adjusting types of proj- ects to local needs.

156645,"The world's production from the aquatic environment, excluding whales, was doubled in the decade between 1952 and 1962, from 22 million metric tons to 45 million metric tons and in the period from 1962 to the present, from 45 million metric tons to about 70 million metric tons. The most rapid growth during this period occurred in the landing of sardine-like fishes, most of which were processed as fish meal and oil, and in the tunas, flat-fish, and squid.  Freshwater fish, excluding those of mainland China, accounted for about 3.25 million metric tons of the 1952 aquatic production, growing only slightly to the present.  An increasing proportion of the catch is being taken in lower trophic levels.  Whatever rate of conversion one adopts, species at lower trophic levels produce a greater amount of protein than do their predators.  To utilize these species, we must bring into production species not now harvested in large quantities or at all.  For this, we will need an imaginative partnership between harvesting technology and food technology.  In managing high seas resources for continual harvest, the problems of international jurisdiction must be considered.  Also, international and national arrangements for research and research institutions must develop programs sufficiently broad to encompass the biological, oceanographic, atmospheric, behavioral, and social scientific programs posed by our use of the oceans in increasingly varied and conflicting ways.","Conference on the Sanitary Quality and Microbial Safety of|Fisheries Products (1970 : Mayaguez, PR)",,4:2,"Sprague, L.

156760,"A measurement of the public costs of programs relating to domestic agriculture when outlays are for varying levels and mixes of land retirement and publicly assisted exports, and when supply control is implemented through different types of land retirement programs.  Also given are potential costs at which food could be provided to recipient countries under different levles of P.L. 480 exports and various choices in types of land retirement programs. It is felt that the choice may not be between 1) a land retirement program and P.L. 480 shipments of the magnitude over the past decade, or 2) a land retirement program of this magnitude and no P.L. 480 shipments.  Rather, it may be a choice between the first and a larger land retirement program to offset cessation of publicly assisted food exports and to maintain prices. Under the latter set of choices, the public costs of food aid then may be marginal; since part of all of the funds to support this international activity might (or would) be needed for larger land retirement and supply control programs.

156786,"In this review of building agricultural systems in developing countries, the following topics are examined in detail:  1) the U.S.'s agricultural research base, 2) agricultural research organizations in the developing nations, 3) technology in U.S. technical assistance programs, 4) adaptive research, 5) specialized agricultural research institutes, and 6) strengthening national research systems.  From this study it was concluded that world food deficits reached a critical stage in 1965-66 as the culmination of a continuing neglect of agriculture and of agricultural technology in the developing nations.  However, special intensive food grain production programs in Asia's developing countries from 1966 through 1968 have brought many of these countries to approximate food grain self-sufficiency or to the expectation that their domestic requirements could be met within a few more years. Nevertheless, short-term food grain production campaigns have not ended the food-population crisis but merely have bought more time.  Food needs are being met in part by improved wheat and rice varieties but will depend most heavily on improved technology.  The development and adaptation of this new technology to meet future needs must be made increasingly in and by the developing nations themselves. Deficiencies in existing national research capabilities in the developing countries have numerous factors, many of which may seem minute but for which there is no single solution.  They can be determined only by a thorough study of each national situation.  Substantial progress could be made by strengthening national research systems through moderate modification of the several individual projects supported by a variety of national, international, and private organizations to ensure positive contributions to the institutional building objectives.",Spanish Ed.: PN-AAG-093,,4:2,"Moseman, A.

319489,"This is a discussion of the public finances of nine current and three recent major A.I.D. recipients.  A principal theme is that donor concern with increasing public revenues, while generally warranted in the past, has resulted in insufficient attention to other aspects of public finance;  e.g., quality of expenditure, the equity problem (equitable distribution of income), efficiency of public enterprise, fiscal side-effects.  In the 1970s, in one form or another, it is likely that these will become major issues.  The Study draws attention to them in a country context.  In the study itself, Part I is a more developed and expanded version of the material used in the Administrator's Review of Development Performance, 1970.  Part II is entirely new material.

177647,"Outgoing airgram of 11/70 reviews PAR (PD-AAH-446-B1) of Bolivian Agrarian Reform Project.  AID/Washington's Evaluation Panel reviewed the PAR to improve its use as a management tool. There is a lack of output indicators and quantifiable data with which to measure the project's success in achieving its goals and end-of-project status, i.e., the lack of records of campesino's cash income prior to project implementation makes it impossible to identify increases that may be attributable to the project.  The evaluation's statement that campesinos will need a source of agricultural credit and technical assistance once land titles have been provided calls into question the whole project purpose of raising rural incomes through processes set in motion by the issuance of land title alone. AID/Washington recommends that future evaluations discuss the project's relationship with the availability and flow of agricultural credit in Bolivia in order to assist in clarifying how to achieve project goals.",,,,"FUNICELLO, A.",,69,M,Miscellaneous Document,,,,,,,,1/12/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1/12/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,27 Nov 1970,1970-11,,,,,,LAND REFORM|Public land records|Cadasters|Agricultural credit|Land tenure|Limited data,,Bolivia,,PD-AAI-327,,,,,False,F|E,,313 KB,PDF,,511,Bolivia,,Evaluation team,003245,USAID.

173681,"7/01/68 - 2/28/70.  THE OVERALL ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT TARGETS HAS BEEN UNSATISFACTORY. 6 CIVIL SERVICE OF PAKISTAN (CSP) OFFICERS RECEIVED TRAINING AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (NIPA) AT KARACHI AND WERE THEN SENT TO THE US TO CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES. SENIOR INSTRUCTORS OF THE NIPAS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING TRAINING IN THE US,AND SHORT-TERM CONSULTANT ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO PAKISTAN'S EDUCATION AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS. THE IMPACT WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE ON THE GOAL OF STRENGTHENING DECISION-MAKING CAPABILITIES,BECAUSE ONLY 6 OUT OF 15 CSP OFFICERS PLANNED FOR RECEIVED TRAINING IN THE US. THIS WAS DUE TO LATE AND REDUCED FUNDING OF THE PROJECT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN'S (GOP) INABILITY TO SPARE THAT NUMBER OF OFFICERS. THE GOAL OF STRENGTHENING PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE GOVERNMENT TRAINING FACILITIES WASN'T ACHIEVED BECAUSE THE CENTRAL PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF THE GOP REFUSED TO COOPERATE. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE NOT ESTABLISHED ON SCHEDULE BECAUSE THE SHORT-TERM CONSULTANT ARRIVED LATE IN PAKISTAN. BECAUSE PLACEMENT IN THE US WAS DELAYED, THERE WAS A DELAY IN TRAINING PARTICIPANTS. THE EVALUATION OF TRAINING AND PLACEMENT OF OFFICERS WASN'TDONE BECAUSE TRAINEES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED. THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN PAKISTAN HAMPERED THE PROJECT. IN LATE 1968,THERE WERE VIOLENT DISTURBANCES,OPPOSITION TO THE 10-YEAR-OLD AYUB REGIME,AND WORKERS' STRIKES. MARITIAL LAW WAS IPOSED. A SHIFT FROM MILITARY LAW TO A POPOLARLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PLANNED,THE 1-UNIT GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WERE BROKEN-DOWN INTO 4 PROVINCES,AND THE SERVICES REORGANIZATION COMMITTEE HAS IMPLEMENTED A REVIEW OF THE PERSONNEL SYSTEM. THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH INADEQUATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE MISSION AND THE GOP. THE MISSION WANTED TO PROVIDE ADVISORY SERVICES TO GOP'S PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT,BUT THE GOP WANTED PARTICIPANT TRAINING ONLY. USAID ADVISORS WERE GIVING SOLUTIONS TO PAKISTANI PROBLEMS BASED ON US EXPERIENCE AND NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE GOP'S PERCEPTION OF THE PROBLEMS.

158118,"KOREAN AGRICULTURE IS SHIFTING FROM SEMI-TRADITIONAL TO MORE MODERNIZED TECHNIQUES OF PRODUCTION AND COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE. THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE A LARGE PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENTAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT. MAJOR INVESTMENTS ARE SEEN IN ALL-WEATHER FARMING, FOOD PROCESSING, MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND STORAGE FACILITIES, AND RURAL ROADS. SINCE CAPITAL IS SCARCE AND COSTLY, INVESTMENT FUNDS MUST BE USED WISELY IF THE GOALS ARE TO BE ACHIEVED. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS ARE THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTE MOST TO NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. A WIDELY ACCEPTED INDICATOR OF A PROJECT'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL IS THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR). THE STEPS IN ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING THE IRR ARE DEVELOPED IN DETAIL IN THIS HANDBOOK. THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD ASSIST LOCAL STAFFS IN DOING AN ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS. THIS HANDBOOK IS ORGANIZED AROUND SIX SPECIFIC CASE STUDIES WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE PROCEDURES AND TECHNIQUES INVOLVED. THERE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADOPTING THESE MATERIALS TO OTHER TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL, FORESTRY, AND FISHERIES PROJECTS.

157885,"DISCUSSES MAJOR CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN RESEARCH AT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH CENTER. THE GOAL OF CENTER RESEARCH HAS BEEN TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -- TO DECIDE WHAT THE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS ARE AND TO FOCUS ON THEM. THEORETICAL MODELS OR CONSTRUCTS PROPOSED AS VALID REPRESENTATIONS OF UNDERDEVELOPED ECONOMIES ARE PRESENTED UNDER FIVE HEADINGS: THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EMPIRICAL WORK; SOCIAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT -- THE MEXICAN CASE; STUDIES RELATING PRIMARILY TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR; THE FOREIGN SECTOR AND GROWTH; AND INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION. THE MAJOR THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE GROWTH CENTER HAS BEEN THE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MECHANISM OF A LABOR SURPLUS ECONOMY AND THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK. THIS MODEL, NOW WELL KNOWN AND WIDELY USED, STARTS WITH THE PREMISE THAT THE AMOUNT OF LABOR IN UNDERDEVELOPED ECONOMIES IS SO GREAT THAT, AT LEAST WITHIN THE TYPICAL INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, ALL OF IT CANNOT BE USED PRODUCTIVELY. THE GROWTH PROCESS INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF LABOR FROM THE ""TRADITIONAL"" SECTOR, WHERE ITS MARGINAL PRODUCTIVITY IS EITHER ZERO OR BELOW A SUBSISTENCE WAGE LEVEL, AND ITS TRANSFERRAL TO THE ""MODERN"" SECTOR (A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF WHICH IS ASSUMED TO BE IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR) AS THE DEMAND FOR IT INCREASES.",,,5:2,,,54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,REPAS-12,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Economic growth|Research,,,,PN-AAD-185,,,,,True,F|E,,"2,610 KB",PDF,,,,,,001306,Yale University.

171725,"TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO THE UNIV OF NAIROBI, (UON)KENYA, TO DEVELOP A SELF-PERPETUATING GRADUATE VETERINARY STUDIES, & RESEARCH PROGRAM. PROJECT PROPOSES TO MAINTAIN & IMPROVE PRESENT LEVEL OF UNDERGRAD TRAINING, EXPAND RESEARCH & GRADUATE TRAINING, AND AFRICANIZE THE PRESENT LARGELY EXPATRIATE FACULTY STAFF. PROJ PLAN INVOLVES TWO CONCURRENT ACTIVITIES: 1. PROVIDING SIX FACULTY MEMBERS FROM THE COLORADO STATE UNIV (CSU) TO THE UON TO BOLSTER RESEARCH & TEACHING AT BOTH UNDERGRADUATE & GRADUATE LEVEL WITH EMPHASIS ON THE CLINICAL STUDIES ASPECT OF THE CURRICULUM; 2. PROVIDING MASTER & PHD LEVEL VETERINARY STUDY AT CSU FOR TWO QUALIFIED UON PARTICIPANTS/YR TO DEVELOP GRADUATES CAPABLE OF ASSUMING FACULTY POSITIONS UPON RETURN TO THE UON. THIS GRADUATE LEVEL PROGRAM CONSISTS OF 1 YR OF COURSE STUDY TOWARD PH.D AT CSU FOLLOWED BY TWO YRS OF DISSERTATION WORK & RESEARCH IN KENYA. THIS PROJECT FOLLOWS SEVERAL PREVIOUS AID & OTHER DONOR PROJECTS CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPING A VETERINARY TRAINING PROGRAM AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL OF UON. PREVIOUS PROJS INVOLVED CONSTRUCTING CLASSROOM & LAB FACILITIES, ESTABLISHING A SOUND UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM, AND THE SUPPLYING OF FACULTY MEMBERS. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THOSE PROJECTS AND THIS ONE IS THAT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF VETERINARY GRADUATES IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE GROWTH & DEVELOPMENT OF A LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IN EAST AFRICA. SUCH AN INDUSTRY DEMANDS VETERINARY SERVICES- AN EXPANDING INDUSTRY DEMANDS EXPANDING SERVICES. THUS, VETERINARY SERVICES ENABLE AN INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP WHICH COULD ELEVATE THE NUTRITIONAL & ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE EAST AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.

168958,"Grant is provided to improve the Government of Paraguay's (GOP) public administration.  Project consists of four subprojects. Subproject four will develop the capability of the National University's In-Service Training Center (ISTC) to provide public administration training and technical assistance to GOP ministries and agencies.  USAID will manage the project in coordination with a full-time UN-financed Systems Analyst to be assigned to ISTC. Assistance will also be provided through the AID/W funded regional contract with Loyola University's Inter-American Center, the Regional Development Centers Project (526005101), and through the full-time services of one Peace Corps Volunteer. The first USAID-financed advisor will help initiate a training program for Organization and Methods (O&M) analysts within GOP ministries and agencies.  Later, additional short-term consultants will work with established task forces composed of agency coordinators (agency liaison personnel with ISTC), the Center's O&M advisor, and the Center's training program coordinator to organize training programs in accordance with needs identified in requirements surveys prepared by the task forces.  These advisors will also assist ISTC staff in carrying out O&M training for approximately 20-30 GOP employees, resulting in a core of competent Paraguayan O&M analysts.  The task forces will also be assisted in expanding ITSC's technical assistance function, with new O&M analysts and Center training coordinators filling important counterpart roles in implementing and evaluating specific activities.  Special technical assistance programs will be conducted with municipalities, autonomous agencies, and GOP public entities.  Finally, ongoing ISTC on-the-job and in-service training programs will be expanded and improved, extension training courses in tax and judiciary administration and municipal management will be continued for public employees in interior cities, and Loyola-type sensitivity training will be conducted for public employees in leadership positions at both the national and local levels.",,,,"DODSON, C.|SHERMAN, S.",,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,26 Oct 1970,1970-10,,,,,,Public administration|Higher education|Management training|Extension services|Administrative occupations|Educational facilities|Technicians|Participants|Indigenous education|Municipal level|Taxation|Technical training|Institution building|Language training|English language|Leadership training|Universities and colleges,,Paraguay,,PD-AAG-295-A1,,,,,False,,,,,,526,Paraguay,,Peace Corps,008590,USAID.

169788,"FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO THE ROKE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND INITIAL SUPPORT OF THE KOREAN DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE (KDI). THE KDI FULFILLS A NATIONAL NEED FOR AN AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION, STAFFED BY THE BEST TALENT AVAILABLE, TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS AND TO ASSIST THE ROKG IN FORMULATING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. THE KDI BECAME AN OFFICIAL OPERATING ENTITY IN 1972, AFTER ONE YEAR OF ADMINISTRATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PLANNING, ASSEMBLAGE OF A BASE STAFF, CONSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICE & RESEARCH BUILDING AND PROVISION OF STAFF HOUSING FACILITIES. UPON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KDI, THE PROJECT SHIFTED FOCUS TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF KOREA'S POST WORLD WAR II ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY IS WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE HARVARD INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (HIID) AND IS IN TWO PHASES. PHASE I INCLUDES RESEARCH FOR AND PREPARATION OF EIGHT MONOGRAPHS, CO-AUTHORED BY KOREAN AND AMERICAN SCHOLARS, ON VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT- RELATED SUBJECTS. PHASE II INVOLVES COMPLETION OF FOUR MORE MONOGRAPHS PLUS A PROJECT OVERVIEW INTEGRATING ALL THE MONOGRAPHS INTO A COHESIVE PERSPECTIVE OF THE KOREAN MODERNIZATION PROCESS. THE EXECUTION OF PHASES I & II ENTAILS DEVELOPING A DESIGN, PLANNING RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, AND ASSEMBLING & TRAINING SUPPORTIVE PERSONNEL - DUTIES PROVIDED FOR UNDER PROJECT FUNDING. THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF THE STUDY ARE: 1. THE STUDY WOULD PROVIDE A VALUABLE INFORMATION RESOURCE FOR THE ROKG; 2. THE STUDY WOULD SERVE AS A CATALYST BY ENCOURAGING NEW DIRECTIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; EXPERIENCE RECEIVED DURING COURSE OF THE STUDY WOULD PROVIDE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC PLANNERS. 4.

IVS rural development specialists will:  (1) identify and marshall development resources at the village level and those national and provincial resources that are available to rural and village development activities; (2) emphasize the need for maximum local generation of financial self-support to supplement and eventually replace subsidies from national and provincial resources; and (3) devise ways to organize and direct the energies of villagers toward modifying and improving village economic conditions, health and sanitation, education, and local administration and government.  In addition, IVS specialists will assist in raising the standards of spoken English in secondary schools, teacher training colleges, and universities through assignments as faculty members of selected institutions.",Attachments include PROAGs of 6/24/70 and 10/9/71|Title supplied by cataloguer,,,,Best available copy -- faded type,13,M,Loan/Grant Agreement,,,,,,,,4/24/1990 12:00:00 AM,,4/10/1990 12:00:00 AM,4/25/1990 12:00:00 AM,4/25/1990 12:00:00 AM,,29 Apr 1970,1970-04,,,,4/10/1990 12:00:00 AM,,Rural development|Community development|Language training|English language,Private voluntary organizations|Self government,Vietnam,,PD-ABA-702,,MK,,,False,E,,"1,669 KB",PDF,,730,"Vietnam (South), Republic of",,,008623,USAID.

230373,"Subproject to increase regional coordination in Central America for population research and planning and public health service delivery. The project will be implemented by the Council of Public Health, comprised of Central American and Panamanian Ministers of Public Health, and the Organization of Central American States (ODECA), the Council's Executive Secretariat. The subproject will develop a regional mass education program in maternal/child health, including family planning; expand the Regional Information Center on Health and Population; implement a regional program for collection and use of demographic and health data; and develop regional training courses for population personnel.  In addition, the subproject will establish regional standards for the diagnosis and treatment of communicable diseases; conduct population studies; organize regional meetings on population/family planning; and develop a regional capacity for mobilizing national and international finances for public health care.  As it progresses, the subproject will decrease its support for ODECA personnel as the Ministers of Public Health assume increasing responsibility for this component of the project.",,,,,,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,7/25/1994 12:00:00 AM,,3/15/1994 12:00:00 AM,7/26/1994 12:00:00 AM,7/26/1994 12:00:00 AM,4/8/1994 12:00:00 AM,30 Apr 1970,1970-04,,,4/18/1994 12:00:00 AM,4/18/1994 12:00:00 AM,4/8/1994 12:00:00 AM,Population programs|Family planning research|Health research|Public health care|Institution building|Health education,Maternal child health care|Family planning|Health professional education|Demographic data collection|Demographic research|Population planning|Communicable diseases|Standardization|Information centers|Health finance,Central America|Panama,,PD-ABH-753,,MK,,,False,F|E,,812 KB,PDF,,596z,Reg Office Cent America & Panama (ROCAP),,,003297,USAID.

318024,"Educational assistance to Turkey (1959-1970) through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is summarized in this document.  In 1959 Turkey's National Educational Commission developed educational policies to which AID responded.  AID projects expanded from the General Education Services Project (1957) into individual projects.  Their purposes and activities are described in the document under nine objectives: (1) to study Turkey's educational plants and to expand its physical facilities for education; (2) to help overcome illiteracy; (3) to increase the amount and type of instructional materials; (4) to introduce teachers to alternative instructional methods; (5) to expand vocational-technical education and increase efficiency in teaching technical skills; (6) to expand knowledge and skill in English language and increase efficiency in English language teaching; (7) to increase the quantity and quality of business and public administrators; (8) to expand research and planning in the Ministry of Education; and (9) to encourage universities to modernize their programs in teaching and research.

A SLIGHT OUTBREAK OF MALARIA OCCURRED IN AN ISOLATED AREA IN 1966, INVOLVING 38 PERSONS, BUT WAS QUICKLY SUPPRESSED. THE EFFICACY OF THE ERADICATION PROGRAM IS MANIFESTED BY THE FACT THAT BETWEEN 1954 AND 1966 NO CASES OF MALARIA WERE DETECTED BY BLOOD-FILM EXAMINATION. SEROEPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN TOBAGO INDICATE THAT IN AN AREA UNDER MALARIA ERADICATION THE IHA ANTIBODIES FALL TO NEGLIGIBLE LEVELS WITHIN 15 YEARS AFTER THE LAST CLINICAL CASE IS DETECTED. SERUM COLLECTED IN 1955 BY THE TRINIDAD REGIONAL VIRUS LABORATORY INDICATED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF MALARIA ANTIBODIES, WHEREAS SERUM OBTAINED IN 1969 SHOWED NEGLIGIBLE LEVELS OF ANTIBODY.

Also included are thematic presentations and committee reports on nutrition and health, nutrition and agriculture, nutrition and child feeding, nutrition and education, nutrition and industry, and coordination of nutrition programs. The general discussions which followed the thematic presentations reflect the sharp focus of attention on such key questions as health and mental development, the relative importance of food crops versus cash crops, the value of nutrition surveys in providing a basis for agricultural trade policies, the enormous need for nutrition education, and the critical need for coordination of nutritional and agricultural policies. Recommendations generated by conference participants include these: That governments organize new services for prevention of childhood malnutrition, and reinforce existing services; that they take steps to integrate the science of nutrition into agricultural programs; that they recognize the importance of food crops for national health and development; that they integrate infant nutrition into preventive medicine, and conduct surveys of the nutritional needs of children, by age group and region; that they encourage breastfeeding as the only nursing method that provides total hygenic security; that they encourage the spacing of births; that they institute new programs of nutrition education; that they inventory local foods with a view toward their use in preparation of weaning foods; that they establish agencies to control prices and quality of foods; that they study the nutritive value and acceptability of industrial by-products that could provide nutritious foods at low prices; and that they give high priority to creating an interministerial coordinating mechanism to conduct nutrition budget and consumption surveys, nutrition education, food technology improvement, and improved planning in food economics.","French Ed.: PN-AAC-676|African Conference on Nutrition and Child Feeding (1979 : Tunis, TN)",,5:1,,,52,M,Conference Proceedings/Paper,,,,PA/AFR(HA)-08-70,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Human nutrition,,Africa,,PN-AAC-675,,,,,True,F|E,,"20,250 KB",PDF,,698,Africa Regional,,,003030,"U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare.

157434,"THIS STUDY DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING AND MEASURING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, DEMAND ON HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES, ACTIVITIES OF HEALTH CENTERS, THE RESULTS OF THOSE ACTIVITIES, AND PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE REORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CENTERS. TO ENSURE DEVELOPMENT OF A METHODOLOGY MAXIMALLY USEFUL UNDER DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE METHODOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO FIELD RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN TURKEY AND AT TWO PROJECT HEADQUARTERS SITES IN INDIA. IN EACH OF THOSE THREE SUB-STUDIES, DATA ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS WERE COLLECTED THROUGH HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, AND DATA ON ACTIVITIES OF THE LOCAL HEALTH CENTERS WERE OBTAINED THROUGH OBSERVATIONS AND INTERVIEWS. SOCIO-ANTHROPOLOGIC INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED CONCERNING THE LOCAL POWER STRUCTURE, ECONOMIC INDICATORS, MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS, ATTITUDES TOWARD THE HEALTH CENTER AND VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ITS WORKERS, AND USES OF OTHER PRACTITIONERS. THE METHODS OF ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION PRODUCED BY THIS STUDY ARE INTENDED FOR USE BY RESEARCHERS CONCERNED WITH IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SERVICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE METHODS CAN BE USED TO DESIGN THE DATA COLLECTION, CONDUCT HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, SAMPLE THE HEALTH CENTER WORK, SAMPLE THE WORK OF FIELD WORKERS, OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF VILLAGE LEADERS, ANALYZE PATIENT FLOWS, ASSESS HEALTH CENTER RECORDS, AND CONDUCT A DATA ANALYSIS FOR A TOTAL EVALUATION OF SERVICES.

177646,"Evaluates project to distribute land titles to Bolivian peasants living on but lacking title to land received under the l953 Land Reform. Evaluation covers FYl970.  No methodology is specified. The project is being implemented successfully and there are no apparent obstacles to achieving targeted outputs by l975.  Mobile units were effective in establishing boundaries and mitigating conflicts in rural area. Nine additional mobile land titling units were delayed in shipping but will be in service by FY71.  A delay in the processing of titles -- only 20,000 of a planned 60,000 titles were distributed -- due to remodeling for a larger computer will be remedied with the computer's final installation in early FY71.  A signature machine has been installed.  The Government of Bolivia has been very supportive in providing basic staff salaries, counterpart funds and establishing the National Agrarian Reform Service (NARS). An attempt to shift the project from a regional to a country contract failed to adhere to AID administrative requirements, but a contract representative has eliminated these problems. Although NARS initially lumped together donations and financial records with little attention to the value or location of funds, a new control syste was implemented in 3/70.  As campesinos are only just now receiving their titles, it is too early to judge how many will be able to obtain credit--a key indicator of the project's true success and lasting impact.  The evaluators conclude that this is one of the best land reform operations in Latin America and that a picture story on the mobile units could be of use.",Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1969-30 Jun 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,AID-511-56T,,,,1/12/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1/12/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,28 Jul 1970,1970-07,,,,,,LAND REFORM|Public land records|Land development|Cadasters|Mobile units|Land tenure,,Bolivia,,PD-AAH-446-B1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,256 KB",PDF,,511,Bolivia,,Limited data,008515,USAID.

175328,"EVALUATES PROGRESS FROM MAY 1967 TO TERMINATION IN DEC 1969 OF SUBPROJECT DESIGNED TO OFFER VOCATIONAL TRAINING TO UNEMPLOYED SLUM DWELLERS IN PANAMA UNDER USAID MANPOWER TRAINING & UTILIZATION PROJECT. EXAMINATION INCLUDED VISITS TO TRAINING CENTERS,DISCUSSIONS WITH TRAINEES & WITH HEADS OF 2 TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. TRAINING WAS PROVIDED FOR 830 UNEMPLOYED HEADS OF FAMILIES IN AN ""ACCELERATED SKILLED & SEMI-SKILLED TRAINING PROGRAM"" COMPRISING 47 COURSES AT 6 LOCATIONS. THE INSTITUTO PARA LA FORMACION Y APROVECHAMIENTO DE RECURSOS HUMANOS (IFARHU), A NATIONAL AGENCY FOR PROMOTING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY,BECAME THE INSTITUTIONAL BASE FOR ADULT VOCATIONAL TRNG AND CONTINUED THIS TRNG AFTER THE SUBPROJECT ENDED. HOWEVER,TRNG ALLOWANCES GIVEN TO PARTICIPANTS FOR FAMILY SUPPORT WERE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF THE PROJ,RESULTING IN AN INCREASED DROPOUT RATE. SUBPROJ EMPHASIS WAS ON TRNG FOR EMPLOYMENT,WITH COURSES BEING TAILORED TO FILL RECOGNIZED JOB VACANCIES. TRNG WAS OFFERED IN THE VICINITY OF GREATEST DEMAND FOR WORK,NOTABLY IN PANAMA CITY & COLON,BUT ALSO IN 4 PROVINCIAL CITIES. A NOTABLE PROJ ACHIEVEMENT WAS THE COOPERATION PARTICIPATION OF EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATIONS. CREATION & CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICIO DE EMPLEO(SENE) WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ELEMENTS OF THE PROJ,PROVIDING A CONTINUING PLACEMENT SERVICE FOR TRAINEES. SENE IS NOW SUPPORTED BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR. GOOD MEDIA PUBLICITY INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE  TRNG PROGRAM. RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FUTURE PROJS THAT WOULD DRAW ON SUCCESSFUL PROG ELEMENTS,AND ON PERSONNEL FROM THE ACCELERATED TRNG PROGRAM.

AIFLD PROVIDES LABOR EDUCATION TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREE AND DEMOCRATIC TRADE UNIONS. EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH USAID PERSONNEL, HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND LABOR LEADERS. THE HONDURAN PROGRAM WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN LABOR EDUCATION INSTITUTE (IESCA), THE USAID-SPONSORED, AIFLD-OPERATED EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR TRADE UNIONISTS FROM ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA. IESCA WAS MOVED FROM HONDURAS TO GUATEMALA EARLY IN 1970 AND THE HONDURAN NATIONAL AIFLD PROGRAM, THAT SHARED ITS INSTRUCTORS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, NOW OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY WITH A MUCH-REDUCED STAFF. IN GENERAL, AIFLD HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE IN DEVELOPING TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP. THE 2 PRINCIPAL REGIONAL LABOR FEDERATIONS NOW HAVE THE INSTRUCTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY TO OPERATE THEIR OWN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THEIR SEVERELY LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, HOWEVER, WILL MAKE THIS UNLIKELY DURING THE NEXT 5 YEARS. AUTHORS RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD CONCENTRATE ON: (1) PROVIDING ASSISTANCE AT MORE SOPHISTICATED LEVELS, WHILE (2) AIDING THE FEDERATIONS IN FINANCING AND ADMINISTERING THEIR OWN BASIC LABOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND (3) TRAINING INSTRUCTORS TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE TEACHING OF BASIC COURSES. EVALUATORS FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR LABOR EDUCATION AND IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES FOR REACHING THEM. TO DATE, AIFLD HAS OPERATED WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WILL GIVE COURSE AFTER COURSE INDEFINITELY. AIFLD'S SOCIAL PROJECTS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. THE THIRD WEEK OF EACH 4-WEEK REGIONAL COURSE FOR CAMPESINOS IS ""ACTION WEEK"" WHEREIN STUDENTS GET PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ASSISTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH SOCIAL PROJECTS.

EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND LABOR LEADERS AND OBSERVATION OF TRAINING. THE ALFLD PROGRAM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SUPPORT FOR THE FREE LABOR MOVEMENT IN GUYANA. ITS MOST SOLID IMPACT HAS BEEN IN THE TRAINING OF LABOR LEADERS IN THE US. THE IMPACT OF IN-COUNTRY LABOR EDUCATION AND THE SMALL SOCIAL PROJECTS HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF THE POTENTIAL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REALIZED. HOWEVER, THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AT THE GUYANA INDUSTRIAL TRAINING CENTER IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. THE LABOR EDUCATION PROGRAM IN GUYANA HAS NOT BEEN ORGANIZED WITH SUFFICIENT THOROUGHNESS: THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN OVERALL COURSE PLANNING, INSTRUCTION, AND AVAILABILITY OF TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER COURSE MATERIALS,AND EDUCATION OF THE RANK AND FILE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT OF LABOR EDUCATION IN GUYANA INCLUDE: THE ABSENCE OF A REALISTIC PLAN AGREED UPON BY THE GUYANA TRADE UNION COUNCIL (TUC) AND AIFLD; INSUFFICIENT DEPTH OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT BY AIFLD; CONFUSION AND FINANCIAL COMPLICATIONS CAUSED BY THE CREATION OFTHE CRITCHLOW LABOR COLLEGE; AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN AIFLD AND USAID/G. A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS THE FINANCIAL STRAIN ON TUC TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE CRITCHLOW LABOR COLLEGE. THUS, THE TUC ENCOURAGES THE FLOW OF AIFLD FUNDS TO CRITCHLOW AND DISCOURAGES THEIR USE FOR EDUCATION IN THE FIELD. THE SOLUTION LIES IN THE ROUGH PLANNING OF A PROGRAM, BASED ON A FRESH ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS, IN WHICH WORKER EDUCATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS AND COURSES AT CRITCHLOW PLAY COMPLEMENTARY ROLES. THE SMALL SOCIAL IMPACT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT THE OVERALL PROGRAM HAS BEEN TOO LIMITED TO ACHIEVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT. CONSEQUENTLY, USAID AND ALFLD ARE NOT DEVELOPING ANY NEW IMPACT PROJECTS. ALFLD PROGRAM MGMT IS HAMPERED BY A LACK OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN USAID/G AND ALFLD.

LESS CONSERVATIVE POINTS OF VIEW AND SHORTER, MORE SOPHISTICATED COURSES SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE URBAN PROGRAMS.

EXPERTS WILL EXAMINE ALTERNATE TECHNIQUES OF IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF CEREALS; I.E., GENETIC BREEDING AND FORTIFICATION. AID WILL USE THE FINDINGS OF THIS CONFERENCE FOR PROGRAM GUIDANCE IN THE AREA OF CEREAL IMPROVEMENT. PROP DATED 5/24/72 EXPANDS PROJECT TO INCORPORATE FOUR NEW ACTIVITIES: (1) EVALUATION OF FISH PROTEIN CONCENTRATE (FPC), (2) EVALUATION OF CORN-SOY-MILK (CSM) AND OTHER BLENDED FOODS, (3) EVALUATION OF NON-FAT DRIED MILK (NFDM), AND (4) INVESTIGATION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF FOOD FORTIFICATION. ACTIVITIES (1) AND (2) ARE CONTINUATIONS OF PROJECTS 9310907 AND 9310926; THESE PROJECTS HAVE NOW BEEN SUBSUMED INTO THE PRESENT PROJECT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPANDED PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE EVALUATIVE DATA AND ANALYSES OF HIGH PROTEIN FOODS TO US COMMERCIAL FIRMS AND LDC INSTITUTIONS TO GUIDE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FOODS FOR LDC CONSUMPTION. FPC IS BEING SHIPPED TO SELECTED LDC'S AND WILL BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE USE AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE EVALUATIONS OF SUCH BLENDED FOODS AS CSM AND WHEAT-SOY-BLEND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL CONTRACTORS IN THE PHILIPPINES, INDIA, AND BRAZIL. THESE EVALUATIONS WILL FOCUS ON THE ACCEPTABILITY AND USE OF BLENDED FOOD IN 3 DISTINCT CULTURES. SIMILAR EVALUATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON NFDM BY LOCAL CONTRACTORS IN APPROXIMATELY 4 COUNTRIES.

168962,"The Smithsonian Institution is contracted to undertake studies to determine the relationship between development efforts and environmental deterioration in the developing world.  Employing both U.S. and host-country scientists, the Smithsonian will conduct macro-ecological surveys of environmental changes in conjunction with selected A.I.D. recipient countries.  The studies will be designed to determine both the nature and intensity of environmental degradation in the LDC's as well as the awareness and capabilitiy of these nations to cope with the environmental aspects of their development plans.  The results of the studies will be published in the U.S. and in the participating countries.  Examples of proposed environmental studies include the following:  (l) a study to be carried out jointly with the Central University of Caracas in Venezuela to determine the capacity of the Ilanos Flood Plain to sustain either agricultural or urban development; and (2) a study of the distribution of aquatic plants, vectors of schistosomiasis and other human diseases, pesticides, and other environmental problems resulting from the construction of a 2,200 foot dam built in 1964 across the Volta River in Ghana. Development of a U.S. institutional base of expertise on environmental problems in the LDC's will begin with the mobilization of personnel for this project.  In addition, ""Early Warning"" manuals, based on previous environmental studies as well as studies carried out under this project, will be prepared to assist in anticipating the ecological effects of future development projects.

175354,"Evaluates Mississippi State Univ (MSU)'s performance in assisting LDC's with seed processing & testing from 3/57 to 6/70.  Proj purposes were to:  1. assess present LDC seed needs & improve LDC programs; 2. develop task order financing methods & future program funding requirements, and 3. develop seed & crop improvement project proposals responsive to LDC's changing needs. Evaluatn methodology undefined. Evaluatn team feels MSU assistance has resulted in steadily increasing budgets over the past 12 years.  MSU has assembled and trained a staff of qualified people on all phases of work and been responsive to technical assistance & training requests. Program has resulted in the development of a prototype seed dryer & handbook on seed drying, seed processing installatn plans, seed testing equipment, and seed processing handbook.  Other beneficial activities have been a seed storage & packaging study; design & specificatn of seed facilities; advice on seed programs; design & testing of low-cost walk-in germinators; assistance of missions, contractors, and sponsored visitors; seed improvements; officer sector training; etc. Team feels that past MSU performance warrants that contract activities be renewed, redefined, and expanded.  Recommendations are that:  1. the 5/27/70 speech of ""Changing Seed Program Needs of LDC's"" be edited & distributed to all USAID's; 2. an in-depth evaluation be made of 2 Latin American countries assisted by MSU; 3. a study and report be made of successes & failures of seed programs in 3 AID-assisted countries; 4. examples identified of profitability which offer sufficient inducement as well as too-low profitability; 5. rural devel, food, and agricultural personnel receive adequate briefing concerning seed programs at regional meetings; and 6. missions receive policy guidelines & implementation instructions on all phases of LDC changing seed program needs and on any ""New Contract Instrument with MSU"".",Evaluation period: 18 Mar 1957-31 Jun 1970,,,"TIBBUTT, THEODORE V.|MONCADA, FRANCIS J.|et al.",,22,M,Special Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/14/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/14/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,31 Jun 1970,1970-06,,,,,,Seed production|Agribusiness|Seeds|CROP YIELD|Varietal research|Financial management|SEED TESTING|Agricultural storage facilities|Technical assistance|Project change,,,,PD-AAC-616-C1,,,,,False,F|E,,"6,811 KB",PDF,,931,Technical Assistance,,Sector level evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation,000035,U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),A,,,,English,application/pdf,A18.M2|M04.33|T29.6C.B|T29.7R.62|A62.32|A68.6|P03.W|A18.M2.3|A33.Q|M06.K4.8|J02.57.M6.E|J08.EP.E|J02.57.M8.4Q,,1,16,,15 p.,,,9310203,9310203,00,22708,,AID/W-607,,,,FROM BREF|Converted to searchable PDF 2011-06-22 (exact OCR),,REPORT OF THE SPECIAL TASK FORCE ESTABLISHED TO REVIEW & EVALUATE THE MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY SEED PROJECT - AID/607 : SEED PROCESSING & TESTING (ON CAMPUS REVIEW),,,,,,22708PD-AAC-616-C1,9310203,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PDAAC616C1.pdf,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),,,False,EN,,,Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Government and law~The state~Government~Public administration~Foreign assistance~Development administration~Development projects|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Breeding~Foundation seed~Seed production|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A18~A18.M~A18.M2|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Science~Biology~Anatomy~Plant anatomy~Seeds|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A18~A18.M~A18.M2~A18.M2.3|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A33~A33.Q|Notation~Notation Collection~T~T29~T29.7~T29.7R~T29.7R.6~T29.7R.62|Notation~Notation Collection~M~M06~M06.K~M06.K4~M06.K4.8|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural economics~Agricultural productivity~Crop yield|Notation~Notation Collection~M~M04~M04.3~M04.33|Document Type~Document Type Collection~Evaluation (all; inc.

176016,"PROJECT TO MODERNIZE AGRICULTURE IN TUNISIA THROUGH EDUCATION IS EVALUATED AS OF 6/30/70. THE MODIFIED US OBJECTIVES FOR THIS PROJECT ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AS OF THE 6/70 TERMINATION DATE. THE CHOTT MARIA AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL IS PRESENTLY OPERATING WITH AN ENROLLMENT OF 466 STUDENTS ENCOMPASSING GRADES 7 THROUGH 12 WITH PLANS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENTS TO OVER 500 BY 10/70, A FULL STAFF OF US TRAINED TUNISIAN AGRICULTURAL TEACHERS, AND TEXAS A&M TECHNICIANS SERVING AS COUNTERPARTS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALL THE NEW BUILDINGS OF THE SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETED, AND ALL NEWLY ORDERED EQUIPMENT HAS ARRIVED. TO DATE, 2 CLASSES HAVE GRADUATED AT THE UPPER SECONDARY LEVEL, AVERAGING 15 GRADUATES EACH. ALL OF THESE GRADUATES HAVE EITHER CONTINUED THEIR AGRICULTURAL STUDIES OR ENTERED THE  AGRICULTURAL LABOR FORCE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT BY 1972, APPROXIMATELY 80 PERSONS WILL GRADUATE FROM CHOTT MARIA EACH YEAR, WITH ABOUT HALF ENTERING THE LABOR FORCE AS AGRICULTURAL TECHNICIANS AND THE REMAINDER CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES IN AGRICULTURE AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL FOR EVENTUALLY ASSUMING PROFESSIONAL LEVEL POSITIONS IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE. IN ADDITION, THE RETURNED US-TRAINED AGRICULTURAL TEACHERS, WHO ARE IN EXCESS TO THE STAFF NEEDS AT CHOTT MARIA, ARE BEING ASSIGNED TO TEACH AT OTHER AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. CHANGES ARE NOTED DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. INITIALLY, A 2-PHASE OPERATION WAS PLANNED INCLUDING CREATION OF A SECONDARY SCHOOL AND DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIV LEVEL PROGRAM INCLUDING NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE SECOND PHASE,HOWEVER, WAS DELETED, BECAUSE THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE EXPANDED ITS FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS MORE QUICKLY THAN ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, THE HORTICULTURE TRAINING PROGRAM PROJECTED FOR THE 1969-70 SCHOOL YEAR WAS CANCELLED DUE TO PRIORITY REQUIREMENTS ELSEWHERE FOR THE STUDENTS.

211093,"Project to explore the potential applications of communications and educational technologies to development.  The project responds to the FY70 Foreign Assistance Act, Section 220, ""Progress for Peaceful Communications,"" which calls for greater use of educational technology and mass communications for development.  An educational policy organization will implement the project's three components:  R&D priorities; uses of national communication systems; and policy studies on implementation strategies. The project will produce guidelines for designing and initiating research programs on the use of communications and educational technologies in LDC environments.  Problems of software, hardware, and systems management will be addressed, resulting in the formulation of research strategies and specific research projects.  These guidelines will be usable not only by A.I.D., but also by other development agencies and private research institutions. The project will also examine how national mass communications systems can be used to promote social development.  Research will examine educational television via communications satellites, as well as via other transmission systems (e.g., ground-based microwave systems) and alternative uses of radio and other transmission systems.  At least three kinds of questions will be examined in detail:  (1) the social and cost effectiveness of alternative uses of communications systems; (2) ways of optimizing the social and educational utility of satellites and other expensive mass communications systems; and (3) the key policy issues likely affect the use of satellite and other communications systems during the 1970-75 period.

175607,"REPORT CONTAINS A DETAILED SURVEY OF ECUADOR'S POLICE FORCES, THE NATIONAL CIVIL POLICE (NCP), AND THE CUSTOMS POLICE (CP), AS WELL AS AN EVALUATION OF AID'S PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM IN THAT COUNTRY, FROM 1959 TO 1969. THE AID PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM CONSISTS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, COMMODITIES, AND PARTICIPANT TRAINING DESIGNED TO ESTABLIHED AN ADEQUATE LEVEL O LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTERNAL SECURITY FOR ORDERLY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SOME IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM HAVE BEEN REACHED. SINCE THE INITIAL PUBLIC SAFETY SURVEY OF 1959, THE NCP HAS IMPROVED IN ALMOST ALL RESPECTS. THE KEY TO THIS IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOUND SYSTEM OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT WHICH PERMITTED NCP TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM HARMFUL OUTSIED INTERFERENCES IN PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. THE AID PROGRAM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OTHER ADVANCES SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BETTER NCP ORGANIZATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CAPABILITY FOR THE CONTROL OF URBAN CIVIL DISTURBANCES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NCP TRAINING INSTITUTION. NCP CAN MEET ABOUT HALF OF THE PROJECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS OF ECUADOR. THE CP, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS MADE FEW ADVANCES SINCE 1959. THE USAID DECISION TO TERMINATE PUBLIC SAFETY SUPPORT TO THIS UNIT IN 1966 WAS SOUND. THE CP MUST FIRST ESTABLISH A PERSONNEL SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NCP BEFORE IT WILL BE ABLE TO PERMANENTLY IMPROVE ITS CONDITION. OTHER OBJECTIVES OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM ARE ONLY ABOUT 50% ACHIEVED. THESE INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE RURAL POLICE CAPABILITIES, ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND MOBILITY, IMPROVEMENT OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES, CIVIL INTELLIGNECE, AND IMPROVED PATROL OPERATIONS. THERE ARE SOME AREAS IN WHICH NEW INITIATIVES MUST BE MADE AND GREATER EMPHASIS BE PLACED, SUCH AS PLANNING AND RESEARCH, INSPECTIONS, BUDGETING YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND CRIME PREVENTION, CORRECTIONS, PROBATION, AND PAROLE.

THERE WAS A DELAY IN ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH ACTIVITY DUE TO THE MATERIALIZATION OF CHEMICAL SIDE AFFECTS ARISING FROM INSECT CONTROL MEASURES. THERE ALSO WAS A SHORTAGE IN PARTICIPANTS TRAINING AT THE IRRI.

177695,"Evaluates project to provide LDC personnel with travel grants for top-level refresher training and to assist in sponsoring conferences intended to integrate LDC scientific communities and exchange current nutrition-related technical information. Evaluation covers the period 6/68-2/70.  No evaluation methodology is stated. Under this project, travel grants will be awarded to selected personnel attending the White House Conference on Children and Youth, the Food Standards Committee meetings of the International Union of Nutrition Scientists (August 4-6, 1970), and the Third International Congress of Food Science and Technology, SOS/70 (August 9-14, 1970). By providing partial expenses and other unidentified entities, the project has secured the in-depth consideration of many key development problems.  Conferences in addition to the regular professional meetings of several groups have been funded and sessions on specific LDC problems have been encouraged. The Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT) International Conference on Amino Acid Fortification of Protein Foods was co-sponsored under this project and addressed a subject related to one of the key problem areas.  AID/W's travel grants for this particular conference complemented those provided by UNICEF, WHO, and other donors.  The ""Persistence of Food Habits"" conference was of direct interest in another key area, with A.I.D. receiving full benefits of the conference in exchange for a minimal share of the costs (travel costs for only two foreign participants).

177080,"Evaluates project conducted by the Community and Family Studies Center (CFSC) at the University of Chicago (UC) to build the capability of selected LDC's to evaluate the impact of family planning (FP) programs on population trends.  Evaluation covers a period ending 2/26/70; no methodology is specified. Some 35 Koreans, representing various FP organizations, attended a workshop, the first of several planned, which was held in Korea and was jointly sponsored by the Government of Korea, A.I.D., and UC. Participants from other countries also attended, as did numerous A.I.D. personnel.  Four specific courses were offered:  (1) Techniques of Fertility Analysis and Measurement of Fertility Change; (2) Improving FP Programs through Evaluation; (3) Sample Surveys for Fertility Measurement and FP Evaluation; and (4) Use of Computers for FP Evaluation and Fertility Research.  Some difficulty was encountered with the computer course since CFSC was slow to prepare a specific computer program which was relevant to Korea. Numerous technical papers were produced which will serve as training guides for evaluating FP program effectiveness. They will also be used as reference material throughout the world. Based on this evaluation, it is recommended that CFSC conduct two workshop/seminars annually in selected LDC's in conjunction with LDC government agencies or universities.  Plans have already been made for joint Goverment of India/CFSC and Hacettepe University (Turkey)/CFSC workshops.  Additional workshops should be designed according to the needs of specific countries and regions. Although CFSC has demonstrated adequate project management capabilities, it is also recommended that A.I.D. handle negotiations for future workshop programs.

176399,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO ESTABLISH THE FINANCIADORA DE ESTUDOS DE PROJETOS, SA (FINEP) TO PROMOTE AND FINANCE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJS DURING THE PERIOD 8/27/65-12/31/69. THIS EVALUATION INCLUDED TESTS OF FINANCIAL RECORDS, INSPECTIONS, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH FINEP, BANCO NACIONAL DO DESENVOLVIMENTO ECONOMIC (BNDE), AND USAID PERSONNEL. FINEP WAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING PRIOR TO RECEIVING ANY FUNDING. IN 8/65,THE MISSION EXTENDED FINEP A NCR$1 MILLION PL480 GRANT TO GET ITS PROGRAM UNDERWAY. IN 10/65,THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PROVIDED A $5 MIL LOAN; AND IN 6/66 USAID PROVIDED $11 MIL IN LOAN FUNDS. ($6 MIL WERE INCLUDED FOR NATURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS.) ONLY 60% OF THE TOTAL FUNDS AVAILABLE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED DURING THE PAST FOUR YRS. OF THE $10 MIL PROGRAMMED EXCLUSIVELY FOR FEASIBILITY STUDIES,LESS THAN 45% WAS OBLIGATED. BNDE HAS BEEN THE ONLY DEVELOPMENT BANK TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER,EVEN BNDE OFFICIALS HAD READILY STATED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUCH AS FINEP. IN 1967,FINEP WAS SUPPOSEDLY TRANSFORMED FROM A FUND TO A PUBLIC CORPORATION. HOWEVER,FINEP MANAGEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO EFFECT REAL CHANGES: BOTH THE PRESIDENT & THE SECRETARY GENERAL HAD ACCUMULATED A MULTITUDE OF OTHER GOVT DUTIES;AND THE US CONSULTANT HAD DEPARTED EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED.

175469,"As of 10/15/70.  Statistics have revealed that Laos is importing a ""very substantial"" amount of food at large outlays of its foreign exchange. Consequently, the Lao government and USAID are giving more emphasis to agricultural diversification along with increasing rice production.  The agriculture program is also responding to the problem of the large increase in the numbers of refugees who are in need of technology that can be put to use to give food self-sufficiency in a short period of time. Introductory plantings of corn, sorghum, peanuts, soybeans, and sweet potatoes were added to the breeding program in dry season 1970. Results are promising with good prospects for productive multiple cropping systems. The rice selection program has selected over 100 new, improved, pedigreed, glutinous lines in wet season 1970.  The new strains are photo-nonsensitive with early maturation.  These new varieties can be planted in June, harvested in September, and other crops can be sown to utilize residual moisture now exhausted by the long maturing varieties. This technology opens up the way for multiple cropping systems in rotation with rice. The combination of direct-sowing rice in rows, with weeding by a Japanese-type hand weeder, offers good promise of cutting labor costs appreciably over traditional transplanting methods.  Direct sown rice matures 7 to 10 days earlier than transplanted rice, and is an aid to multiple cropping agriculture. Japanese-type 2-wheeled tractors give decided advantages in land preparation over buffalo power. Testing of a new system of packaging and distributing rice seed, in cooperation with St. Regis Paper Co., gives promise of making new high-vigor seeds available directly to villages by the next crop growing season, after their performance has been confirmed in the regional yielding ability trials.",Evaluation period: Through 15 Oct 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,23 Dec 1970,1970-12,,,,,,Agricultural research|Crop diversification|Limited data plus,Rice|Varietal research|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Fertilizers|Seed testing,Laos,,PD-AAD-416-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"2,239 KB",PDF,,439,Laos,,Limited data plus,008567,USAID.

175727,"Second Project Appraisal Report of Customs Administration Project in Ethiopia covers 12/69-12/70 period.  Project as now envisioned assists the Ethiopian Customs Administration (ECA) to efficiently operate a uniform customs tariff system.  A US Customs Bureau team is providing assistance. Project as modified is now on schedule.  Performance of both US Customs Bureau advisors & cooperating country personnel is rated outstanding, a marked improvement over the course of the reporting period in the latter case.  Project has been fully accepted by Ethiopian counterparts; skilled personnel have been assigned in sufficient numbers to adequately accomplish needed outputs.  The Counterpart Project Leader is rated superior in his planning & mgmt skills. The implementation of project plans has not as yet been fully tested. An organizational study of ECA has been completed; staffing changes in the first phase are being made.  Yet to be fully implemented are a manifest-type merchandise control system, a uniform entry processin system, & formal staff training.  Operational methods & guidelines for division operations are likewise yet to be established. Work operations have been reduced from 69 to 34 in trial basis uniform entry processing implementation.  Efforts will be made to reduce the rate of disputed classification & valuation decisions from a present 10% rate of entries filed to 0.5% & the time to resolve such decisions from up to 180 days down to 30 days. Revision of PROP is proposed to conform with the goal/purpose/outputs of reformulation.  Also proposed are assignment by AID/W of a full-time Customs Advisor and examination of the need for a TDY Tariff Rate Setting Specialist; examination of the need for participant training; establishment of a public information mechanism to inform the public and Ethiopian organizations of customs procedural requirements and tariff changes; completion of the reorganization plan of Customs Administration headquarters; and a study of ways to maximize revenue collection within the framework of existing tariff schedules.",Evaluation period: 11 Dec 1969-18 Dec 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,18 Dec 1970,1970-12,,,,,,Consumer education|Information storage and retrieval systems|TAX COLLECTION|TAXATION|Technical training|Continuing education|Educational facilities|National level|Customs operations|Manuals and handbooks|Project change|Limited data plus,,Ethiopia,,PD-AAB-930-G1,,,,,False,,,,,,663,Ethiopia,,Logframe change|Project appraisal report (PAR),008543,USAID.

CURRENTLY, 70% OF THE RADIO PROGRAMMING FACILITY HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND EFFORTS AT ESTABLISHING AUDIO-VISUAL AND DUPLICATING FACILITIES ARE ABOUT ONE-THIRD COMPLETED. TO ASSIST THE RLG IN COLLECTING AND MAINTAINING DATA, TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE INITIATED. WITHIN THE U.S., M.S. TRAINING WAS OFFERED IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS TO ONE LAOTIAN STUDENT, AND AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT TO ANOTHER. THAILAND-BASED TRAINING IN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS WAS TO BE AVAILABLE TO 60 OTHER STUDENTS. SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE THESE STUDENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN SPECIFIED.

177070,"Evaluates project to develop an inhibitor of the ovulation hormone, LH, for possible use as a contraceptive.  Evaluation covers the period 6/30/70-12/31/70; no methodology is specified. Two main lines of research have been conducted:  (1) work directly related to the isolation and molecular characterization of the hypothalamic hormone, LRF, including examination of its mode of action at the pituitary level; (2) experiments using hypothalamic peptides of native or synthetic origin other than LRF, but closely enough related to be significant.  Approximately 125 micrograms of LRF were isolated -- by far the most potent preparation of LRF ever obtained according to Salk Institute records and other pertinent literature. Biological studies in vivo and in vitro indicated that highly purified LRF stimulates secretion of both LH and FSH.  In vitro studies indicated that progestational steroids, as well as estradiol in large does, partially inhibit the release of LH and FSH.  Studies have also been made to determine the effect of TRF on the secretion of the glycoprotein, TSH, which is closedly related in structure to LH.  It is anticipated that within the next 6 months, the full structure of an LRF active polypeptide will be obtained, including its replication by total synthesis.  Also anticipated are specific leads on synthetic analogs that would act as antagonists to TRF and hence to LRF; and further insight into TRF's and hence LRF's mode of action at the subcellular level.  A major stumbling block in all studies is the considerable heterogeneity of the normal pituitary tissue.  Major efforts are being made to obtain homogeneous pituitary cell populations which could be studied like a bacterial culture medium.  The mass spectrometer and its computer readouts are now working routinely. Overall, the program is proceeding as planned.  However, the availability of only exceedingly small quantities of pure LRF causes great concern.  In response, two investigators and two technicians will activate the necessary equipment and begin extraction of approximately one half million sheep hypothalamic fragments to isolate additional LRF.",Evaluation period: 30 JUN 1970-31 DEC 1970,,,"GUILLEMIN, ROGER",,31,M,Periodic Report,,,,AID/CSD-2785,,,,6/8/1981 12:00:00 AM,,6/8/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,31 Dec 1970,1970-12,,,3/23/1983 12:00:00 AM,,,Contraceptive agents and devices|Contraceptive research|Basic research|Limited data,,,,PD-AAG-255-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,031 KB",PDF,,932z,Population and Humanitarian Assistance,,Limited data,002171,Salk Institute for Biological Studies,A,DST/W-1128,,,English,application/pdf,S14.4|S14.K2|T03.4|B19.V,,1,33,,,,,9320518,9320518,00,24426,,,,,,FROM BREF|Converted to searchable PDF 2011-09-27 (exact OCR),,"PROGRESS REPORT ON SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES FOR THE PERIOD JUNE 30, 1970-DECEMBER 31, 1970",,,,,,24426PD-AAG-255-A1,9320518,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PDAAG255A1.pdf,002171 - Salk Institute for Biological Studies,,,False,EN,,,Notation~Notation Collection~S~S14~S14.4|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Communication~Information~Limited data|Notation~Notation Collection~S~S14~S14.K~S14.K2|Document Type~Document Type Collection~Program Documents (all)~Periodic Report|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Population and demography~Family planning~Family planning research~Contraceptive research|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Science~Research~Basic research|Notation~Notation Collection~T~T03~T03.4|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Population and demography~Family planning~Contraceptive agents and devices|Notation~Notation Collection~B~B19~B19.V,6/8/1981 4:00:00 AM,3/10/2013 9:23:11 PM,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,,,Guest,,,,,,

173811,"EVALUATES THE PROGRAM FOR GRADUATE TRAINING IN ECONOMICS (PGTE) AT THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF PERNAMBUCO (UFP) IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL FOR THE PERIOD 1966-1969. PGTE WAS CREATED TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED ECONOMISTS IN THE BRAZILIAN NORTHEAST. THE REPORT IS AUTHORED BY THE ACTING HEAD OF PGTE, A USAID-FINANCED VISTING PROFESSOR FROM VANDERBILT. PGTE HAS EXPERIENCED SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT THEY ARE TYPICAL OF THE EARLY STAGES OF OTHER LATIN AMERICAN GRADUATE TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. THE GRADUATES HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WELL-PAID JOBS. PGTE HAS BUILT A GOOD TEACHING STAFF AND IS CURRENTLY AWAITING FURTHER REINFORCEMENT FROM PROFESSORS BEING TRAINED ABROAD. THE 1969 PROGRAM OF STUDY DIFFERED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM WHAT WAS PLANNED. DEPARTURES WERE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN STATISTICS AND ECONOMETRICS WHERE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE NECESSARY COURSES WAS OFFERED. THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE DIVERGENCIES WERE THE RELATIVELY HIGH RIGOR AND SOPHISTICATION DEMANDED BY THE TEACHER, THE RESISTANCE OF THE STUDENTS, AND THEIR POOR UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING. AT PRESENT, THEN, COURSES CANNOT BE TAUGHT IN THE PGTE WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION FOUND IN US UNIVERSITIES. THE 1970 PROGRAM OF STUDY, THOUGH INCOMPLETE AND SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED IN ITS RANGE AND LEVEL OF INSTRUCTION, IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE BRAZILIAN NORTHEAST AND CONSISTANT WITH THE STUDENTS' MODEST BACKGROUND IN ECONOMICS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF PGTE'S LIMITATIONS IS THE LACK OF PROFESSORS: A CORE OF AT LEAST 6 FULL-TIME PROFESSORS, TEACHING EXCLUSIVELY FOR PGTE, IS REQUIRED. EXTENSION OF USAID/VANDERBILT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE CONDITIONED ON A FORMAL COMMITMENT BY UFP TO APPOINT THESE PROFESSORS AND EITHER OFFER THEM COMPETITIVE SALARIES OR ALLOW PGTE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR SALARIES WITH INCOME FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS OR TO CONDUCT 3 FIELD-DATA-GATHERING TYPE RESEARCH PROJECTS - EVIDENCE THAT PGTE IS PROGRESSING TOWARDS EVENTUAL SELF-FINANCING.

175312,"Reviews history and current status of the School Lunch Program in Brazil as of 4/70.  The School Lunch Program is a joint effort between the Brazilian Ministry of Education (CNAE) and USAID/Food for Development (USAID/FFD) to establish an effective national, state, and locally supported school feeding program. USAID/FFD feels that the program is a success.  A viable institution has been created. The CNAE administrative body has grown from a few persons to a full-fledged, effective, and dedicated staff functioning at the national, regional, state, state-regional (sector), and municipal (local) levels. The national program has grown from a level of approximately 3,000,000 students attended per day (CY's 1962 and 1963) to the present level of 5,500,000 students attended per day (CY's 1970 and 1971) with USAID/FFD commodity inputs.  The Government of Brazil (GOB) estimates total program coverage (GOB plus USG inputs) to be 11,013,845 children for CY 1970 and 12,604,842 for CY 1971. The annual USAID/FFD tonnage has increased progressively from an initial 10,000 MT per year in CY 1964 (non-fat dried milk only) to 47,000 MT in CY 1970 (including wheat flour, bulgur, rolled wheat, rolled oats, cornmeal, corn-soy-milk, non-fat dried milk, and vegetable oil). During CY 1971 the USG input will be reduced to 33,000 MT. This decrease follows the established plan for a gradual USG reduction and a simultaneous GOB increment in commodities furnished to the CNAE. Due to a budgetary problem, CNAE has not fulfilled its obligation to buy non-fat dried milk or cornmeal. This has resulted in shortages to the Northeast. CNAE has reached and possibly surpassed its capacity to absorb greater quantities of food without improving and increasing its staff. As is generally the case, the northeast region suffers from this lack of administrative expertise even more than the central and southern states. Another serious difficulty plaguing some northeastern states in recent years is correct care of commodities.  Poor warehousing, planning, and logistics have caused some large losses and many other small losses at the local level.",,,,"STOLZ, W.

175313,"Evaluates the Feed Grains Program in Brazil as of 4/70.  The program utilizes US feed grains provided under PL-480 Title II (Food for Development) to stimulate livestock and poultry production. Of the 14 feed grain projects initiated, 5 have already received all the earmarked grain, and 5 others will receive all of their grain by 6/70. An evaluation report of 4 of the older Feed Grain projects has demonstrated the advantage of using Title II grain in Brazil as ""seed capital"", to assist cooperatives to acquire needed facilities.  The Title II grain has enabled cooperatives to use other capital for improving production, marketing, and processing services to their members. The use of Title II grain has resulted in effective development projects.  The projects meet USAID goals of using Title II resources to increase agricultural production and to encourage the participation of increasing numbers of people. Where projects have received all of their PL-480 Title II grain, the cooperatives are now using facilities to make balanced rations, slaughter and freeze birds, grade eggs, or process milk. As the input of Title II grain ended, most of the cooperatives began to buy increasing amounts of local grain.  This has contributed to the stimulation of local grain production. The projects have also supplied the cooperatives and their members with technical guidance which resulted in increased efficiency in farm operations and larger net incomes. The feed grains program in Brazil and especially in the Northeastern and Northern areas had been plagued by a variety of problems involving most phases of livestock/poultry production and the collection, processing, and distribution of the products for consumers. Problems resulting from the new provision for ""matching contributions"" are the most worrisome.  Due to seasonal variations, locally produced grain can be very expensive and often difficult to find.  AID/W has also stipulated that funds generated from the utilization of Title II grain cannot be used to finance the ""matching contribution"".",,,,"HUBER, J.

175714,"Reports on USAID assistance from 3/1/70-3/31/70 to improve tax administration in Guatemala. Work continued on the implementation of control procedures for property tax matriculas valued at Q10,000 and over.  The minister has requested that the register information be placed onto punched IBM cards and that lists of delinquent taxpayers be issued to Departmental collectors. USAID will provide four adding machines to assist in collecting delinquent property taxes.  The US Advisor has been asked by the National Planning Council to assist in drafting the plans for a unified tax agency.  Also, the US Advisor completed a study of the administration of toll road collections. Six toll booths will be installed in the center of the roads as opposed to the present practice of locating them on one side of the road.  Cash registers which classify the type of vehicle and different toll rates will be substituted for the practice of printed paper receipts.  USAID will provide three of the six cash registers. Guatemala's quota was increased from two to four participants for the INTAX O&M seminar. Collection statistics for ordinary and consigned revenues for the month of Feb are attached to this report.  The Income Tax Directorate attributed the decrease in income tax collections to losses suffered during the floods of 1969.  However, total tax collections were 6.9% greater than those collected for the same priod in 1969.

241835,"Loan to the Government of the Congo to finance the commodities and related services needed to improve the effectiveness of two transport sector agencies which have deteriorated since the Congo became independent in 1960:  Congo Transport Development Office (OTRACO) and Marine and Navigable Waterways Services (Voies Navigables).  Items to be financed include a floating dry-dock facility for the port of Boma and other equipment urgently needed for effective river transport, the keystone of the Congo's transportation system. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches.  The condition for the first tranche is evidence that a formal decree reorganizing OTRACO and Voies Navigables has been issued and is satisfactory to the UN Development Program/World Bank.

THE RESULTING UNCLEAR DESIGNATION OF AUTHORITY DELAYED PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. USAID HAS AGREED TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITY ADVISORY SERVICES TO THE NEW ""TRAINING, RESEARCH, AND EVALUATION CENTERS"".

GIVEN THE SCARCE HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES, A GOOD OBJECTIVE WOULD BE THE EVENTUAL INTEGRATION OF HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING CLINICAL SERVICES, BUT SEPERATE ADMINISTRATIVE AND MOTIVATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF COOPERATION.

176772,"Evaluates project to assist the Philippine Police Commission (POLCOM) develop better law enforcement capabilities in the areas of basic police skills, communications, and law enforcement commodities and techniques. Evaluation covers the period 1/31/69 to 5/31/70.  No methodology is indicated. Substantial progress was made in the last year in all project activities, despite additional demands for specialized training and the temporary suspension of the participant training program (now reactivated) during the period of student unrest.  Six regional training centers have been constructed at strategic locations.  Construction of four more is underway. Development of standard programs of instruction is 95% complete, and of training aids and manuals, 65% complete.  Basic and advanced courses have been provided to 2,700 and 8,900 trainees, respectively, of respective life-of-project targets of 20,000 and 10,000.  In-service training for graduates of the basic course will begin when 60% of those targeted for the basic course have been trained. All of the revised target of 1,250 senior officers have received basic training. The Community Police Improvement Program is ahead of schedule. Several departments have implemented a newly-developed organizational structure, including organizational charts. Traffic management and criminal investigation activities are, however, behind schedule. Communications capabilities have improved substantially, especially at the provincial level, allowing rapid police response between cities and municipalities.  However, neither the law enforcement communications system nor the law enforcement teletype system have yet been implemented. A record and identification component has been added to the project to create a nationwide records management system and improve recording capabilities at both national and local levels.  A number of data systems have already been developed in connection with this component, ahead of scheduled completion time. An earlier commodity procurement problem due to POLCOM has been resolved.",Evaluation period: 31 Jan 1969-31 May 1970|Title provided by cataloguer,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,12 Aug 1970,1970-08,,,3/23/1983 12:00:00 AM,,,Police|Communications technology|Police services|Public administration|Vocational training|Management information systems|Indigenous education,,Philippines,,PD-AAH-191-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"2,179 KB",PDF,,492,Philippines,,Onsite evaluation|Limited data,008592,USAID.

THE FIRST PRO/AG WAS SIGNED IN 1968 WITH THE US TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING A COBALT 60 RADIATION UNIT), SUPPLIES AND COMMODITIES. THE GOVT OF TUNISIA AGREED TO PROVIDE A LABORATORY (TO HOUSE THE RADIATION UNIT AND TO MASS REAR MEDFLIES), PERSONNEL, VEHICLES, AND OTHER LOGISTICAL SUPPORT. THE RADIATION UNIT WAS NOT DELIVERED UNTIL CY69, MORE THAN A YR AFTER IT WAS ORDERED. THE GOT COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAB IN 5/69, BUT IT WAS NOT EQUIPPED AND FULLY OPERATIONAL UNTIL 12/69.

154788,"Low agricultural yields in the 8.625 million square miles that make up Equatorial Africa can only increase if a more scientific use is made of the soil.  This report studies soil characteristics, taxonomy, cultivation, and fertility in Equatorial Africa and suggests methods for increasing productivity. Predominant characteristics of soils in Equatorial Africa as compared to soils of humid temperate regions are: deeper pedons with fewer remaining weatherable minerals; lower percentages of silicon and montmorillonite; higher percentages of iron, aluminum, and kaolinite; lower cation but higher anion exchange capacities; lower buffer and available water capacities; higher degree of friability; less accumulation of leaf litter; a laterite layer that hardens with exposure to cycles of wetting and drying (continuous cropping); and smaller reserve of total and available plant nutrients. Soil taxonomies of Equatorial African soil are provided using both the U.S. and the D'Hoore systems.  The U.S. system classifies these soils as 22% Oxisols, nearly 32% Aridisols, 23% Alfisols, 11% Entisols, 6% Inceptisols, 4% Ultisols, and 2% Vertisols; and describes suborders, vegetation, moisture, texture, and soil temperature characteristics. Special attention is focused on the soils of Ethiopia and Ghana and on ground-water laterites. The predominant crop pattern in Equatorial Africa -- shifting cultivation (i.e., allowing land to ""bush"" so that trees can shade the soil and return biomass to the soil surface) -- is likely to continue along with the subsistence agriculture system that will dominate for the forseeable future. The author gives reasons for continued low productivity and a lack of alternatives to the shifting cultivation pattern: (1) high cost of technological inputs (e.g., fertilizer); (2) scarcity of rural infrastructure (e.g., roads); (3) prevalence of human and animal disease; (4) lack of individual owner-operated farms; (5) high illiteracy rates; and (6) a preponderance of small, fragmented farms on infertile land.

155251,"The study consisted of five separate but interrelated objectives. The first objective was to determine the agricultural credit situation in India with emphasis on Mysore State. The second objective was to describe some characteristics of Mysore State that affect the success of credit proposals such as soils, climate, population, land area, and crops. The third objective was to present an illustrative example of a farmer in Mysore State who is interested in adopting new farming practices through the use of credit. The fourth objective was to examine conceptually some of the major issues, such as farmer's attitudes toward supervision of loans that are important in the design of credit programs. The fifth objective was to present some pertinent areas in which research into agricultural credit is needed.","Thesis (M.S.) -- University of Tennessee, 1970",,2:1,"Cashdollar, P.

155283,"The article examines the diminishing viability of import-substitution manufacturing policies, which is now apparent in most of Latin America. Since this pattern of development has not succeeded, an alternative is discussed and recommended which would utilize land reform to redistribute income, employment, and investment possibilities of the massive peasant agricultural subsector, thus enabling many more persons to purchase light consumer goods and otherwise participate more actively in the economy. This expansion of the market would allow industry to grow in directions which have highly elastic demand, require low amounts of imported materials, and offer semi-skilled employment opportunities in areas other than the largest cities. Post reform expansion of agricultural production and income would also provide governments with an additional source of revenue via taxes, amortization payments, dropping input prices, and/or inflation. These revenues would be reinvested at growth points where the disparity between private and social returns is greatest.",,,2:1,"Thiesenhusen, William C.",,54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,AID/csd-2263,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1970,1970,,,,,,Economic development|Industry|Land reform,,Latin America,,PN-AAA-507,,,,,True,F|E,,750 KB,PDF,,598,Latin American Regional,,,001794,University of Wisconsin at Madison,A,,,,English,application/pdf,D25.J|M04|A59.3|G06.2,,1,23,,,,,,,,2630,,,,,,FROM RANDD|Converted to searchable PDF 2010-08-18 (exact OCR),AE00,Suggested policy for industrial reinvigoration in Latin America,"Land tenure center paper, no. 72",,,,,2630PN-AAA-507,,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PNAAA507.pdf,001794 - University of Wisconsin at Madison,,,False,EN,Agricultural economics,,Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Economics~Economic administration~Economic development|Notation~Notation Collection~G~G06~G06.2|Document Type~Document Type Collection~Technical Reports (all)~Other USAID Supported Study/Document|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A59~A59.3|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Geographical areas and countries~America~Latin America|Notation~Notation Collection~D~D25~D25.J|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Industry and technology~Industry|Notation~Notation Collection~M~M04|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agrarian reform~Land reform,3/8/1979 5:00:00 AM,3/11/2013 12:34:54 AM,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,,,Guest,,,,,,
155402,"Aquatic plants have potential as feedstuffs in certain nations, but the economics of harvesting and processing would prohibit their direct utilization as a forage in technologically advanced nations. However, nutrient pollution is accelerating rates of eutrophication of natural waters in many areas. Aquatic plants produce large standing crops and accumulate large amounts of nutrients. Systems based on the harvest of aquatic plants have potential application in removing nutrients from effluents and natural waters. Large quantities of all elements essential for plant growth would be removed in proportion to their compositional ratios in the particular species. Plants could subsequently be used as forage to partially offset the cost of nutrient removal. The actual feasibility of these systems must be tested with pilot studies. These studies will require an interdisciplinary approach, and much research will be required. This paper has been intended to merely point out the apparent potential of aquatic angiosperms for nutrient removal. If usable, such systems would turn undesirable nutrient pollution into fertilizer to increase aquatic plant production, and the economics of nutrient pollution abatement would be improved.",,,2:3,"Boyd, C.

PROJECT PURPOSE IS TO ASSIST THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE) TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PLANNING, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF SCHOOL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, AND EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 2 LATE SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS,PROJECT PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN HIGHLY SATISFACTORY. AN ARCHITECTURAL SECTION IN THE MOE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN BOTH COOPERATIVE IN SUPPORTING SERVICES OF THE ARCHITECTURAL SECTION OF MOE AND PROVIDING OFFICE SPACE. THE GOVT OF UGANDA (GOU) HAS BEEN TIMELY IN PROVIDING ITS SHARE OF THE COSTS (1/2) FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL FOR PARTICIPANTS. A MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL HAS BEEN PRODUCED. THE SELECTION,ORIENTATION AND PLACEMENT OF UGANDANS TRAINED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPERVISORY POSITIONS HAS BEEN EXCELLENT. SEVENTY-ONE MOE CONSTRUCTIONS WERE CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHITECTURE SECTION. FURTHER,NEW AND IMPROVED BASIC DESIGNS FOR SCHOOLS,LABORATORIES,DORMITORIES,AND STAFF HOUSING HAVE BEEN OR ARE BEING AMDE. ALTHOUGH CONTRACTOR HAS PERFORMED WELL,THE GOU HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE. THE PARTICIPANT ELEMENT WAS REDUCED FROM 64 TO 53 TRAINEES BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS TERMINATED 2 YEARS EARLIER THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED. TRAINING AND INCREASES IN PERSONNEL ARE NECESSARY IN MOST SECTORS IF UGANDANS ARE TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOVT,MANAGERIAL,AND OPERATIONAL POSITIONS. USAID SHOULD TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION WITH MOE TO EITHER OBTAIN A COUNTERPART US ARCHITECT OR BEGIN TRAINING A UGANDAN FOR THE POSITION.

LIBRARY COLLECTNS MUST ALSO BE EXPANDED,& CURRENT RESEARCH PUBLISHED. PLANS FOR ADDING A PHD PROGRAM ESSENTIAL FOR IPE'S MORALE MUST WAIT  UNTIL FACULTY & FUNDS ARE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. STUDENTS ARE TRAINED AT IPE, VU & OTHER SELECTED US UNIVERSITIES. MOST TRAINED IN THE US HAVE RETURNED TO IPE FACULTY POSITNS. IPE STUDENTS ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR TRAINING & ACCESS TO PROFESSORS WHO,ALTHOUGH YOUNG,HAVE MORE PRACTICAL ECONOMICS EXPERIENCE THAN PROFESSORS MUCH OLDER IN US INSTITUTNS. IPE'S  CURRICULUM IS COMPARABLE IN MOST CASED TO A FIRST YEAR US PROGRAM,EXCEPT IT OVERLY EMPHASISES ECONMETRICS & IS WEAK IN FISCAL & MONETARY POLICY. TWO WELL-KNOWN ECONOMISTS SHOULD BE RECRUITED EACH SEMESTER TO IMPROVE IPE'S EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS USAID & FORD FOUNDATN CONTINUE FUNDING IPE 2 MORE YEARS UNTIL IT CAN SOLICIT FUNDS. IPE FINANCES ONLY 25 PERCENT OF HER COSTS LARGELY DUE TO LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR & OTHER INCOME FROM GRANTS,CONTRACTS,& INTERNATNAL ORGANIZATNS. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS FINANCES BE IMPROVED BY SOLICITING FUNDS,CONVERTING SCHOLARSHIPS TO REPAYABLE LOANS DUE AFTER GRADUATN & EMPLOYMT,& REQUIRING UNIVERSITIES BENEFITING FROM IPE'S EXTENSN ACTIVITIES TO PAY THE COSTS. EVALUATOR FEELS STUDENTS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR ADMISSION AFTER THE ENTRANCE EXAM BY INTERVIEW & THAT STIPULATNS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED REQUIRING APPLICANTS HAVE BS'S IN ECONOMICS. EVALUATOR ALSO RECOMMENDS IPE INCREASE ITS ENROLLMENT TO 25 STUDENTS PER YEAR, AND THAT VU USE AID FUNDS TO SPREAD TRAINING TO OTHER US CAMPUSES.",Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1964-1 Dec 1971,,,"LEVY, FRED D.",,22,M,Special Evaluation,,,,,,,,7/11/1979 12:00:00 AM,,7/11/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,6 Jan 1970,1970-01,,,,7/20/1984 12:00:00 AM,,Educational administration|Student admissions|Student testing|Curriculum design|Management operations|Economics education|Graduate education|SCHOLARSHIPS|Higher education|Educational development|Faculty|Faculty exchanges|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data,,Brazil,,PD-AAA-291-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"8,354 KB",PDF,,512,Brazil,,Country program evaluation|Indepth evaluation,008517,USAID.

Inspeccion de Hacienda has employed a four-man team in the Directorate of Rentas to investigate the substantial discrepancies which are coming to light.  Because the Controllers Office did not accept the temporary receipt designed by the Income Tax Directorate, the two collectors recently contracted were not able to begin work.  However, a new format was agreed upon and the receipts printed. Collection will now begin in Feb.

PAR NOTES THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM IS EVIDENCED BY THE OCCUPATIONAL SUCCESS OF RETURNED PARTICIPANTS. REGARDING THE PRESENT PROJECT, PAR INDICATES PROJECT PROCEEDED AS PLANNED: TRAINING CANDIDATES APPEARED HIGHLY QUALIFIED; THEIR NOMINATIONS WERE TIMELY; AND THIS PROJECT WAS WELL PUBLICIZED WITHIN CONGOLESE AND AID CIRCLES. THE ONLY PROBLEMS WHICH AROSE WERE THE RESULT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BARRIER AND THE LACK OF AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT SETTING THE EQUIVALENCY OF DEGREES, I.E., THE EUROPEAN LISENCE VIS-A-VIS THE BA AND MA DEGREES. THE FACT THAT THE CONGO IS A FRENCH SPEAKING COUNTRY LIMITED THE NUMBER OF CONGOLESE  IN AID-ORGANIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS. MANY SHORT TERM COURSES WHICH COULD HAVE MET CONGO NEEDS WERE NOT OFFERED IN FRENCH. THUS,NO PARTICIPANTS COULD BE SENT. MOST UNIVERSITY PARTICIPANTS HAD TO TAKE 4-6 MONTHS OF INTENSIVE ENGLISH TRAINING IN WASHINGTON BEFORE ENROLLING IN A UNIVERSITY AS THERE WAS NO FACILITY PROVIDING THIS TRAINING IN THE CONGO. AS A RESULT OF THE DEGREE EQUIVALENCY PROBLEM, MANY PARTICIPANTS HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT AND SALARIES COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR LEVEL OF EDUCATION. PAR RECOMMENDS THAT ALL UNIVERSITY PARTICIPANTS BE PLACED IN US UNIVERSITIES HAVING 3 YEAR PHD PROGRAMS -- SKIPPING THE MA ALTOGETHER. THOSE PARTICIPANTS WHO AFTER ONE YEAR OF STUDY  PROVE INCAPABLE OF ACHIEVING THE PHD COULD BE TRANSFERRED INTO A PROGRAM LEADING TO AN MA ONLY.

160583,"Reviews progress to date on a runoff distribution strategy in which rain water is harvested in collectors and then channeled to nearby crop areas. The report explains that an inexpensive short-distance irrigation method is badly needed in sunny, potentially arable regions where the limited rainfall is lost through excessive runoff. The basic principles and history of the proposed runoff distribution strategy are outlined and a diagram of its operation is provided. The report next describes a conceptual model of the strategy. The model was developed to determine the most successful ratio of crop area for any region of known hydrologic and soil characteristics. Finally, a computer program for the testing model is discussed in detail, and ongoing field validation tests now being conducted near Tucson, Arizona, are described. Although no crop yield or crop survival rate results are yet available, it is felt that the desert strip farming runoff strategy is promising. Rainfall charts and a map are included.",,,6:4,"MATLOCK, W. G.|DAVIS, P.

160602,"REPORTS ON A CONTROLLED STUDY OF IMMUNOLOGIC RESPONSES OF COLOMBIAN CATTLE TO BABESIOSIS. FIVE GROUPS OF 20 CATTLE EACH WERE VACCINATED WITH LIVE OR KILLED BABESIA VACCINES AT PALMIRA, COLOMBIA. IMMUNE RESPONSES OF THE VACCINATED ANIMALS WERE EVALUATED BY SEVERAL IMMUNO-SEROLOGIC METHODS. THE DEGREE OF RESISTANCE TO TICK-BORNE CHALLENGE WAS DETERMINED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF RECOVERY TO NORMAL PARAMETERS USED IN THIS STUDY. THOSE INCLUDED PACKED CELL VOLUMES, PERCENTAGE OF PARASITEMIA, BODY TEMPERATURES, BODY WEIGHT, COMPLEMENT FIXING ANTIBODY TITERS, GENERAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, AND PERCENT RECOVERIES AFTER TICK-BORNE CHALLENGE. THE RESULTS IN GENERAL INDICATE THAT RESISTANCE TO BABESIOSIS CAN BE PRODUCED BY CO-INFECTIOUS OR STERILE IMMUNITY. EXPERIMENTS IN PROPHYLAXIS, BASED ON RESIDUAL ACTION OF THE BABESIOCIDAL DRUG, GAVE CONSISTENT AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS. IN FUTURE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP CONTROL PROGRAMS AGAINST BOVINE BABESIOSIS, BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS.","MEETING OF AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF VETERINARY PARASITOLOGISTS : Las|Vegas, NV, US",,5:1,"TODOROVIC, R.

176395,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC POWER TO THE HELMAND VALLEY IN AFGHANISTAN. EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 10/15/69 TO 06/15/70. SINCE THE LAST PAR, OVERALL PROJECT PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY. THE DATE SET FOR COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WAS EXTENDED FROM 4/1 TO 7/1/70 DUE TO THE DELAY IN ARRIVAL OF 2 GENERAL ELECTRIC TRANSFORMERS DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT. REPAIR TO ONE WILL BE MADE IN THE US AND THE OTHER WILL BE REPAIRED IN KANDAHAR. HOWEVER, A 3-MONTH LABOR STRIKE AT GENERAL ELECTRIC HAS DELAYED THE REPAIRS AS WELL AS SHIPMENT OF OTHER COMMODITIES. NRECA TASK ORDER 7 WAS EXTENDED 1 YEAR TO 7/71, THEREBY ALLOWING 12 MOS OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR AFGHAN PERSONNEL IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. RGA FUNDING FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE IS STILL INADEQUATE, BUT IS IMPROVING. FOR EXAMPLE, ABM (AFGHAN POWER AUTHORITY) PURCHASED A 150KW DIESEL GENERATOR, INCLUDING SPARE PARTS, FOR KANDAHAR FROM AN AMERICAN CONTRACTOR. ALSO, A NEW MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE WAS CONSTRUCTED IN KANDAHAR. PROVISION OF DIRECT HIRE TECHNICIANS HAS BEEN ADEQUATE. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION IS BEING DONE BY AFGHAN CREWS, WITH ONLY GENERAL SUPERVISION BY AMERICAN FOREMEN. EVALUATORS NOTE THAT MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL POWER COMPANY LEVEL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. NO MAJOR CHANGE IN PROJECT PURPOSE OR DESIGN IS RECOMMENDED.

176783,"Evaluates project to improve the Government of Paraguay's (GOP) tax administration.  Evaluation covers the 1969 calendar year.  No methodology is indicated. A number of highly desirable changes were implemented in response to a more desirable political climate for introducing progressive improvements in tax administration.  A new section was installed in the real property tax office to mail out delinquency notices and handle appeals.  In addition, a team of tax collectors was organized to try to liquidate the large outstanding delinquent accounts balance.  A scaled-down list of penalties to encourage delinquents to pay up back accounts was prepared, the decentralization of the real property tax office was ordered, and the conversion of over 250,000 property tax records to punch cards was proceeding ahead of schedule.  An audit program, complete with training for new auditors, was instituted in the income/sales tax office, and taxpayer orientation lectures were given on the new sales tax law.  A special campaign in the internal tax office increased cattle transfer and slaughtering stamp sales by 60%.  This office has also been conducting a continuous taxpayer information campaign.  Current organization charts were developed, new forms have been introduced, and document processing was improved in all offices. There was a 31.2% increase in tax collections, but as most of this was due to new tax measures, this type of revenue growth cannot be expected to continue throughout the entire project.  In summary, overall achievement of project targats is rated as superior. USAID plans to expand its Internal Revenue Service tax advisory assistance to include a second full-time advisor (a collections advisor) for a 2-year tour beginning in FY 71, to include a part-time audit/data processing advisor to establish audit programs and forms and prepare required procedural manuals, and to send Paraguayan tax observation teams to select Latin American countries to generate GOP interest and knowledgeable support for implementation of tax administration reform.

176902,"Evaluates contract with the Vinnell Corp. to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to establish and staff a regional repair and maintenance shop (ROS) as part of its Accelerated Rural Development (ARD) Program.  This final evaluation covers the period from 6/64 to 5/70.  No evaluation methodology is indicated. With substantial help from Vinnell, a regional overhaul shop (ROS) was built at the Northeast ARD center in Korat, and less elaborate shop complexes have been set up in each province in which ARD is operative. The Vinnell training courses at Korat were very important, since trained personnel in the operation of heavy equipment were essentail to the project. On-the-job training  however, had mixed results. Also with Vinnell help, the ROS repaired $10 million worth of equipment. Activities at the provincial level are harder to quantify, although Vinnell has been active at that level also.  With the help of ROS, ARD has been able to construct 2,400 kms of standard roads; 1,500 kms of service tracks, village streets, and access roads, and to engage in numerous other construction projects.  The biggest disappointment was the failure to convince RTG officials of the value of maintenance and supply management. Also, management problems that had existed within ARD from the start continued and inadequate supervision was visible at all levels.  This was reflected in equipment nonuse and misuse, and a depression of individual morale and loss of whatever spirit ARD personnel had achieved during their training experiences with Vinnell. The non-availability of repair parts caused project delays and was often a result of fiscal management difficulties.  After 1966 there was a let down on the part of the contractor, particularly at the management level, due to the dissolution of contractor training, the deterioration of ARD support, and the degradation of all parties.  The separation of contract representatives from the contractor's operational area made communication difficult and reduced their effectiveness.  Also, contracts should not be made on a fixed price basis and repeated short-term extensions should be avoided.",Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1964-1 May 1970,,,"KINGERY, MICHAEL I.",,24,M,Final Evaluation Report,,,,,,,,4/6/1981 12:00:00 AM,,4/6/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1 May 1970,1970-05,,,,,,Labor intensive technology|PUBLIC SERVICES|Road maintenance|Vehicles|Roads|Transportation system design|Public works|Road construction|Access roads|Indigenous education|Institution building|Technicians|Technical training|Limited data,,Thailand,,PD-AAM-267,,,,,False,F|E,,884 KB,PDF,,493,Thailand,,Onsite evaluation,008613,USAID.

176394,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO DESIGN AND INSTALL TWO 1500KW PACKAGED DIESEL GENERATORS TO ALLEVIATE A CRITICAL POWER SHORTAGE IN THE CITY OF KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN'S SECOND LARGEST CITY. THIS EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 11/05/66 TO 05/04/70. LOAN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON 11/05/66 FOR AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $800,000 FOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE COSTS OF THE PROJECT. R WBECK &amp; ASSOCIATES WAS CONTRACTED TO PREPARE SPECIFICATIONS AND CONTRACT DOCUMENTS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF THE 2 GENERATORS, SUPERVISION OF THEIR INSTALLATION, AND SUPERVISION AND TRAINING OF AFGHAN PERSONNEL IN OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR 3 YEARS AFTER INSTALLATION. FAIRBANKS-MORRIS WAS CONTRACTED (2/22/70) TO CONSTRUCT AND INSTALL THE DIESEL UNITS. BECK &amp; ASSOCIATES DID NOT MAINTAIN PROJECT SCHEDULES. BECK TOOK 3 MONTHS LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO PREPARE THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN AND FINAL SPECIFICATIONS. DELAYS ALSO OCCURRED DUE TO BECK'S SLOW RESPONSE CONCERNING FUEL OIL SPECIFICATIONS AND SITE WORK. FUEL SPECIFICATIONS WERE MAILED TO BECK ON 1/13/69, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL 3/21/69 THAT BECK INFORMED THE AFGHAN POWER AUTHORITY THAT LOCAL FUEL WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT, IN THE FUTURE, AID CONSIDER DIRECT PURCHASE OF PACKAGED DIESEL GENERATORS FOR THE BORROWER IN LIEU OF CONTRACTING THIS SERVICE. WITH DIRECT PURCHASING, THE PROJECT COULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED ONE TO ONE-AND-A-HALF YEARS EARLIER WITH SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTIONS. RGA HAS AGREED TO FINANCE AN OVERRUN OF $93,540 IN PROCURING THE DIESEL UNITS FROM FAIRBANKS-MORSE. THE AFGHAN POWER AUTHORITY (ABM) COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE SPACE, WAREHOUSE FACILITIES, AND OTHER WORK AT THE SELECTED INSTALLATION SITE.

175318,"Evaluates project to establish a police telecommunicatns system in Costa Rica from 1966 to 1970. On-site observatns were made. Evaluator judges overall proj performance poor &amp; recommends considerable changes as soon as time &amp; funds permit. Indicated statn locatns are not necessarily correct &amp; some are not operating. The 13 police telecommunicatns networks reflect a lack of long-range planning for maximum coverage utilizing the minimum number of radios and providing flexibility for expansn and cross communicatn compatibility. The administrative command and single sideband nets all are on different frequencies and should be placed on one frequency since they all service the same elements of the police and often have the radios located in the same room. Single sidebands nets are presently restricted to daytime use due to unusable nighttime frequencies. Radios of various nets are not in use due to a lack of ability to use them, lack of spare parts for repairs, and/or a preference not to use radios. Although the central warehouse is clean and orderly and stock control cards are accurate and up-to-date, the quantity of radios and other electronic equipmt not in use is excessive; the repair sectn is a confusion of spare parts; small hand tools are limited; work orders on equipmt deadlined or repaired are non-existant; and funds for repairs are limited and difficult to obtain. Recommendatns are to replace the present tech with a Spanish-speaking telecommunicatns advisor who will submit monthly reports and be under PSD supervisn. One frequency near the center of the assigned block should be country-wide frequency with one channel of all radios tuned to it. All low-band nets should be replaced with high bands on the same block of frequencies and consolidated into a single integrated country-wide backbone system linking San Jose with all sectns of Costa Rica.

169032,"Grant is provided to the Government of Uruguay (GOU) to strengthen key GOU export promotion agencies.  The International Marketing Institute (IMI) will be contracted to assist the newly authorized (but not yet established) GOU Directorate General of Foreign Commerce and the Export Promotion Agency to strengthen their institutional structures and staffing, to formulate programs and activities, and to provide guidance and training to counterparts. Principal IMI assistance will consist of a long-term advisor (18 person-months) and a short-term seminar consultant.  The long-term advisor will consult with the Directors of the GOU agencies on export issues and assist in coordinating their activities with other A.I.D. export promotion efforts. Also, the long-term advisor will schedule and provide support to short-term advisors, assist in field surveys of exportable products, and participate in seminars and training programs for GOU staff. In addition to participating in GOU training programs, the seminar advisor will help recruit and orient short-term consultants.  The consultants to be recruited will include specialists in international marketing of meats and meat products, dolomite, and in-product packaging and shipping. USAID will offer US or third-country training to GOU personnel in the fields of international marketing and foreign trade promotion.  In addition, a U.S. advisor will be assigned to the National Standards Laboratory.  This advisor will suggest improvements in the GOU's complicated ""reintegro"" and drawback system for non-traditional exports, assist in setting standards for selected food products, identify laboratory staff for U.S. or other training, and work with individual food product exporters (particularly in the fish and dairy industries) to improve their processing techniques.

Work continued on implementation of control procedures for property tax matriculas valued at Q10,000 and over. Errors in values resulted in additional tax charges of Q17,600.  Missing account cards with property values of Q2,206,143 resulted in additional tax charges of Q33,055. The income tax collectors began work 2/6.  However, the accounts were dated 1963/64 and locating the taxpayers was difficult.  The Social Security Administration is not cooperating, stating that they cannot legally give out addresses.  The Directorate General hopes to secure Ministerial assistance. In Feb, nine pay orders were collected totalling Q404.72. Reports covering Income Tax and Property Taxes were submitted to the National Planning Council.  Collection statistics for ordinary and consigned revenues for 12/69 and 1/70 are attached.  Tax receipts were $10.6 million, an increase of 8.6% for the same period for 1968.

175662,"Evaluates performance of the Intn'l Planned Parenthood Federatn (IPPF) in 64 countries from 1/67 to 12/70.  Purpose of IPPF is to enhance family planning (FP) activities in devel countries.  Report was prepared by proj manager. As more countries enter into FP, proposals are carefully reviewed and coordinated with the relevant Regional bureau, population officer and desk, Mission/Embassy, and other officers to assure appropriate use of AID funds, and that funds do not duplicate what has been done by other donors. Guidelines, workshops, seminars, and specialized trng are in progress to aid planning, implementation & admin improvements. Since the demand for FP is a head of govt action in most LDC's, IPPF is expanding its staffs, strengthening and refining programs devel, info, education, mgmt, and staff evaluation capabilities. No major issues need to be resolved.  AID and IPPF have worked together to establish an appropriate framework for assuring the soundness of IPPF programs and AID funds.  IPPF performance has been satisfactory and its contribution to policy and program development and implementation have been a significant stimulus to FP programs and concerted action to population problems.  IPPF has submitted comprehensive and detailed reports in a timely manner.  The policy of obtaining reviews and comments from Missions/Embassies receiving copies of grants, approved programs, and reports have generally been constructive.  In Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Ghana where the program has been in operation for several years, IPPF's influence has begun to have effect on natn'l policy and action programs.  The mobilization of local leadership, and the international and private charactistics of IPPF which is attractive to local governments and peoples has enabled it to function successfully and expand in many politically and culturally sensitive situations. Continued funding is recommended.  Also, additional guidelines are being prepared & an increased number of workshops, seminars & individual trng sponsored to professionalize program planning.",Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1967-1 Jan 1970,,,"WALKER, IRENE B.|RAVENHOLT, R.

175754,"Third Proj Appraisal Report of FY64-FY79 Irrigation component of Agric Dvlp Proj in Laos reviews proj status as of 8/1/70.  Proj was designed to administratively & technically upgrade Laotian Govt (RLG) Irrigation Service and provide assistance in the dvlp of a broad-based, highly visible irrigation program that will increase agric production. PAR notes changes in proj design that will require a new PIP. Over 170 small irrigation projs are now in operation.  Additional pump projs have been installed.  A soils scientist has begun survey work, adding to an already extensive basic data collection.  The number of RLG employees trained in Thailand has now increased to 48.  The number of irrigable hectares continues to increase as planned and the project itself, given important modifications in its design, now judged to be on schedule. Trng of irrigation service professional staff has been reoriented to emphasize trng at the current level of ability: certificate-holding candidates no longer being sought for professional positions; rather trng will start from the bottom up to dvlp potential candidates. On-the-job trng is to be provided to sub-professional personnel. Engineering aides and rural dvlp workers will receive in-service trng with candidates for out-of-country trng to be selected from this field. New emphasis for FY71 has been placed on the maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation of existing projs & facilities. Large-scale projs are currently being deferred in recognition of security constraints and the lack of capable RLG manpower inputs requisite to the operation, maintenance & management of such large irrigation projs.  The Nam Tam proj is progressing on schedule and should be completed by the end of FY72, but the Vientiane Pumping Proj, demonstrated to be feasible in a US Bureau of Reclamation study, is being divided by USAID into flood control & irrigation subprojects.  The former is to be quickly implemented, but the latter is to be deferred pending completion of already-begun irrigation projects and evidence of RLG resource and management input capabilities.",Evaluation period: 1 Dec 1969-1 Aug 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,5/3/1979 12:00:00 AM,,5/3/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,17 Nov 1970,1970-11,,,,,,Water resources|Natural resource development|DRAINAGE|Water management|Continuing education|WATER SUPPLY|Participants|Professionals|On the job training|IRRIGATION|Project change|Limited data plus,,Laos,,PD-AAD-415-G1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,633 KB",PDF,,439,Laos,,Project appraisal report (PAR),008567,USAID.

175572,"Evaluates the agricultural production subproject for the State of Tamil Nadu, India, as of 12/31/69.  The subproject seeks to institutionalize patterns of cooperation between the Agricultural College and Research Institute and the agricultural extension services of the State Department of Agriculture. There has been a substantial improvement in the relationships and coordination between the research and extension personnel of the State and, to a limited extent, the private sector agencies in the implementation of State agricultural programs.  The 2 US advisors and 6 Indian technicians directed most of their efforts on a promotion program to achieve a rapid increase in the acreage planted with high yielding rice varieties.  The promotion program was highly effective in achieving farmer acceptance and provided a good test of the validity of the package of farm practices.  The limited number of US advisors, however, compromised effectiveness.  Technical assistance, the principal USAID input in this subproject, would have been more efficient if a full staff had been on board to demonstrate a well balanced, coordinated, interdisciplinary approach. As this subproject matures in the next 2 years, there must be less dominance by the American advisors so that the Indian counterparts will be in active control when US assistance phases out.  Author mentions that the project has been evaluated by an outside evaluation team of Sloan-Davis and GOI personnel.  The outside evaluation team pointed out that the basic design is valid and problems encountered are mostly staffing problems and the usual operational and management details.",Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,12 Nov 1970,1970-11,,,,,,Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|RICE|Cultivars|Crop yield|Agricultural extension|Universities and colleges|Agricultural education|Food production|Agricultural production,,India,,PD-AAD-105-F1,,,,,False,F|E,,575 KB,PDF,,386,India,,Limited data,008557,USAID.

175580,"Project Appraisal Report for 1969 calendar year assesses performance of FY 68/FY 73 Agricultural Production Proj in Indian state of Bihar. Subproj was designed to overcome traditional and inherited practices and to help develop technical skills and mgmt capabilities within the State Dept of Agric and the state research facilities, thereby assuring full application of inputs in the production, distribution, & marketing of higher-yield foodstuffs.  Under a contract with the Univ of Missouri, US agric specialists are being provided to supervise, along with Indian counterparts, implementation of Field Problem Units in project areas: agric information; plant protection and pest control; and water use and mgmt.  A fourth area, seed production, has been abolished with the departure of the American advisor; in its place, a soil fertility position has been established.  Proj planning and mgmt were hampered by an unfilled vacancy in the water use and mgmt area and by the departures of the plant protection & pest control, and the seed production advisors.  Required reports were not always promptly submitted and often lacked clarity.  The State has had difficulties in getting Indian Govt approval of its partic trainees, but problems have evidently been cleared up with 4 slated to depart for the US in 1970.  The 2 high level participants that have been trained were both promoted upon their return into non-proj related positions.  On the positive side, measurable progress has been achieved in the formation of an Agric Information Council and through regular dissemination of information.  The conducting of a pest control survey has been expanded by the State into a regular operating procedure. The Mission finds no design changes warranted and sees confirmation of project soundness in the Spring 1969 Sloan-Davis evaluation.  With a full team in 1970, significant progess is anticipated.",Evaluation period: 1 Jan1969-31 Dec1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,AID/nesa-321,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,12 Nov 1970,1970-11,,,,,,Agriculture|Information services|IRRIGATION|PEST CONTROL|Audiovisual educational materials|MASS MEDIA|Farmer training|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Agricultural extension|Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|Cultivars|Crop yield|Cereals|Food production,,India,,PD-AAD-107-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,552 KB,PDF,,386,India,,Limited data,008557,USAID.

Cartography work has begun and a post-enumeration evaluation survey is scheduled.  The GOP has given its explicit commitment (in the FY'70 PRO/AG) to continue the household survey as part of the regular activities of the Statistics Bureau.

STUDENT EVALUATORS INDICATED THAT THE COURSES WERE USEFUL; SOME WERE JUDGED VERY GOOD. PARTICULARLY FAVORABLE MENTION WAS ACCORDED THE TRAINING IN COMPUTER APPLICATION AND THE COURSE IN SURGE PHENOMENA IN POWER ENGINEERING. THE COURSE IN POWER ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALS WAS CONSIDERED TOO ELEMENTARY. MORE RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS RECOMMENDED ON HYDRAULIC AND MIXED SYSTEMS IN THE COURSE ON POWER GENERATION OPERATION AND CONTROL,AS WAS EMPHASIS ON STABILITY IN THE POWER SYSTEM ANALYSIS II COURSE. COURSES IN ATOMIC INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT AND IN ENGINEERING ECONOMICS MET WITH SOME CRITICISM,PARTLY DUE TO LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES.

212723,"Subproject to study insect and rodent control in rural and village storage of food grains in Nepal.  This pilot project will compare traditional storage methods with modern techniques, and study the potential advantages of the widespread use of improved storage to spread out the marketing season and to reduce the seasonal pressure on the transportation infrastructure and central storage facilities.  In addition, the research will determine whether local villagers can be encouraged to invest their own capital for improved modern storage bins. Specifically, the project will install 15 metal grain storage bins, each with a capacity of about 5 tons, and compare these with traditional bins of the same size and at the same locations by measuring the grain losses in each bin after a specified period of storage time.  At the end of the project, the bins will be sold to interested farmers at cost.",Attachments include Pro-ag of 9/16/71 and termination agreement|Project title: Food grain technology (On-farm storage),,,,Microfiche not available -- faded type,13,M,Loan/Grant Agreement,,,,,,,,9/12/1990 12:00:00 AM,,8/30/1990 12:00:00 AM,9/13/1990 12:00:00 AM,9/13/1990 12:00:00 AM,,25 Sep 1970,1970-09,,,,8/30/1990 12:00:00 AM,,Agricultural research|Post harvest operations|Food storage|Pest control|Agricultural storage facilities|Pilot projects|Economic aspects,,Nepal,,PD-ABB-416,,HS,,,False,P|E,,"2,802 KB",PDF,,367,Nepal,,,008583,USAID.

175054,"Special evaluation by joint Philippine-American team of 1968-70 operations of Provincial Development Assistance Project (PDAP). Project undertaken to help provincial governments do better job in planning/executing programs in agriculture, infrastructure/public works & financial development priority areas. Team assessed PDAP headquarters operations & status of dvlp programs in 8 PDAP-pilot provinces. Varying levels of achievement observed in provinces; most progress evident in public works/equipment area due largely to USAID assistance in US surplus acquisitions.  Agricultural efforts beset by shortage of field technicians & lack of coordination efforts with national/provincial agricultural authorities.  Financial area most deficient with great need to improve provincial budgeting & implement/enforce real property tax assessment/collections, thereby increasing revenue. Evaluators emphasize that strong commitment of provincial governors critical to project success.  Provincial Dvlp Councils, previously unwieldy & inactive, must be streamlined.  Dvlp Staffs require PDAP training & full-time directors to develop/manage quality programs. Integrated comprehensive approaches based on feasibility assessment must replace hastily-conceived, narrow action programs. Team judges PDAP headquarters emphasis on pilot province operations wise, but faults PDAP for not fully utilizing staff/resources, particularly in training/research.  Evaluators call for more dynamic/concerted approach. Recommendations include:  1) PDAP Planning/Coordinating Committee should be converted into Exec Committee to meet monthly & act as strong policy arm; 2) National Econ Council (NEC) Chairman should no longer serve as Project Director; rather NEC rep should be appointed director & full-time deputy director should oversee operations/supervise staff; 3) Deputy director should develop 12-18 month action program with specific targets; 4) Organizational units should be created to offer field expertise in consultation/training/policy research; 5) Ongoing activities should be replaced by one-year coop agreements with provinces; prior surveys; target objectives.",Evaluation period: 1 Jan1968-4 Sep1970,,,"BRADY, JAMES R.|GULLERMO, MARIANO J.|FRONDA, ROBERTO E.",,22,M,Special Evaluation,,,,,,,,2/13/1979 12:00:00 AM,,2/13/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,4 Sep 1970,1970-09,,,,,,Agricultural extension|TAX COLLECTION|Taxation|Government policy|RICE|Public works|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Financial management|Provinces|Development planning|Project change|Limited data plus,,Philippines,,PD-AAA-414-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,526 KB,PDF,,492,Philippines,,Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation,008592,USAID.

FEASIBILITY REPORT FOR THE BALOG-BALOG RESERVOIR/IRRIGATION PROJ IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION BY 12/31/70. A MAJOR PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE LACK OF LAND CLASSIFICATION DATA. THIS AREA HAS IRREGULAR TOPOGRAPHY & FINE TO COARSE-TEXTURED SOILS WHICH COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS PROBLEMS. TECH TEAM ALSO PROVIDED GUIDANCE IN MAPPING & LAND CLASSIFICATION FOR THE WORLD BANK-FINANCED UPPER PAMPANGA IRRIGATION PROJ. THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC WORKS & NIA EACH ASSIGNED 5 TRAINEES TO LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF BUREC LAND CLASSIFICATION & TO PARTICIPATE IN FIELD STUDIES. 8 OF THE 10 TRAINEES HAVE REMAINED ON THE JOB & DEMONSTRATED THEIR CAPABILITY TO BECOME  COMPETENT LAND CLASSIFIERS. BY 6/30 FIELD WORK WAS COMPLETED FOR ABOUT 100,000 HA -- WITH 300,000 HA REMAINING. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE TO UPGRADE THE BUREAU'S WATER QUALITY LAB. ALSO,THE QUALITY OF STREAMFLOW RECORDS DETERIORATED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YRS. THE CURRENT PROG INCLUDES APPROX 428 STATIONS WHICH GREATLY EXCEEDS AVAILABLE FUNDS & STAFFING. AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT THE BUREAU REDUCE THE STATIONS TO A NUMBER THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY MAINTAINED. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDED MGMT OF A USAID MAPPING PROG IN WHICH TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS WERE PRODUCED FOR 10 RESERVOIR SITES IN THE CENTRAL LUZON BASIN. ALSO PHOTOMOSAIC MAPS OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS WERE COMPILED FOR 7 RIVER BASINS. ANOTHER MAPPING & SURVEY PROG IS BEING INITIATED FOR THE BALOG-BALOG PROJ. USAID HAS CONTRIBUTED EXTENSIVE FUNDS FOR GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING 3 DRILLING MACHINES FOR TEST-BORING & MAPPING OF ACQUIFERS. PURCHASE OF A REVERSE CIRCULATION ROTARY DRILL RIG IS PROPOSED. 7 GROUNDWATER GEOLOGISTS & DRILLERS WERE SENT FOR US TRNG. TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PRODUCING WELLS CAN BE OBTAINED AT SHALLOW DEPTHS(LESS THAN 200FT) IF PROPERLY CNSTRCTD & GOOD ACQUIFERS ARE PRESENT.",Evaluation period: 1 OCT 1969-30 JUN 1970,,,"BARCLAY, M.

TOTAL AWARDS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ORIGINAL PROJECTIONS DUE TO THE GRANTING OF PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. (ANY WITHDRAWALS OR SUSPENSIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS TOTAL.) AMOUNT OF LOAN IS DIVIDED BETWEEN $458 MONTHLY AT RIVAS AND $350 AT ESTELI. WITHIN THE TOTAL OF 294, 40 STUDIENTS RECEIVED PARTIAL LOANS OF $150 A MONTH AT RIVAS AND 39 RECIVED PARTIAL LOANS MONTHLY AT ESTELI. PARTIAL LOAN RECIPIENTS HAVE LOWER EXPENSES SINCE THEIR HOMES ARE NEARER TO SCHOOLS. NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL STUDENTS AND GRADUATES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS PROJECT. THE RESULT IS THE STRENGTHENING OF THE QUALITY OF TECHNICAL COMPETENCE AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.

175176,"AID-contracted study explores East African veterinary sector requirements and the capability of the University of Nairobi's Veterinary College (UNVC) in meeting these requirements.  The study examines the background of the animal industry and the state of veterinary medicine in East Africa, assesses veterinary manpower requirements and the prospects for the development of self-sustaining (Africanized) veterinary education institutions.  It examines the potential for the development of national veterinary schools.  The study offers a positive assessment of USAID's contribution to the regional veterinary education program at UNVC through its contract with Colorado State University (CSU).  Despite some shortcomings in AID and CSU participation in previous projects funding UNVC classroom and laboratory facilities and establishing an undergraduate veterinary program, the author of the study feels it imperative that AID support be continued in the development of a graduate veterinary education faculty with the goal of maximal Africanization of this faculty.  Study recommends renewal of CSU contract but makes specific stipulations with regard to CSU involvement in the undergraduate and graduate programs and the procurement of its faculty.

176086,"Evaluates proj to develop an efficient & integrated system of air transportation ground facilities & services in Thailand as of 02/31/70. The development of an improved civil aviation capability in Thailand had ""spin off"" benefits such as improved communication for local political & internal security purposes, and increased mobility to local & central govt leadership.  In addition, the opening of new airports and introduction of new lighting & communication systems permitting night-time & low-visibility flights at existing airports provided high impact evidence of the RTG's concern for national development. Procurement was generally timely & responsive.  In individual instances, there were excessive delays due to US govt procedures or scarceness of some critical commodity because of the Vietnam conflict. Principal examples were one yr delays in receiving airport lighting control cables and RCAG (radio communications, air, ground) equipment, and the excessively drawn-out procurement of a compass locater.  For the most part, host-country funding has been adequate. Counterpart funding, however, presented difficulties.  The main drawback was RTG's obligation of funds for one yr only, and always a number of months after the start of the fiscal yr. The acquisition of sites was slow because of complicated land purchase procedures required for RTG procurements. Other problems included a severe shortage of Thai technicians, engineers, and management personnel, and low RTG salaries.  No project changes are recommended since the project is in its last yr.",,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,FE(OB)16-00,,,,10/24/1979 12:00:00 AM,,10/24/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,13 Oct 1970,1970-10,,,,,,Building renovation|Navigation|Electronic equipment|Airports|Transportation facilities|Air traffic control|Vocational training,,Thailand,,PD-AAD-591-E1,,,,,False,F|E,,608 KB,PDF,,493,Thailand,,Limited data,008613,USAID.

Evaluation was completed on 10/19/70. Evaluation methodology is not specified. The project is proceeding adequately.  To date, a total of 97,000 megatons of Title II commodities have been provided, mostly to targeted recipients.  Extra food obtained under the program is being utilized to feed deserving, non-eligible recipients such as the ill and indigent. Project management, however, leaves much to be desired.  The implementing office, the Child Feeding Division of the Section of Youth and Sports, has no infrastructure, and lacks an adequate operating budget.  Its staff is small and relatively ineffective.  As a result, the management of many centers has been marginal, lacking central authority support in such areas as equipment, transportation of commodities, and technical advice.  In addition, there have been delays in clearing commodities from the docks to the gouvernorats.  This should be rectified by the completion of a warehouse in Tunis, which is scheduled by 10/70. Inadequate record-keeping has also been a problem, as has a lack of enforcement of uniform procedures governing the operation of some of the centers.  Government of Tunisia (GOT) reports indicate that 170,000 pre-school children are being provided with food under the program. However, on the basis of actual observations of selected municipal centers, there is reason to believe that the figures are actually closer to 130,000.  The extra food being obtained under the program is being used by feeding the sick and indigent.  The Mission is currently making efforts to effect a substantial improvement in GOT backstopping and record-keeping to assure that all food is henceforth channeled to the target group.  Until the goal of 170,000 pre-school children being fed is met, the number of recipients will not be increased.",Evaluation period: Through 30 Sep 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/7/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/7/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,19 Oct 1970,1970-10,,,,,,CHILD NUTRITION|Villages|Nutrition education|Educational centers|Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Limited data plus,,Tunisia,,PD-AAF-255-D1,,,,,False,E,,"1,333 KB",PDF,,664,Tunisia,,Limited data plus,008616,USAID.

153457,"Evaluates project to assist the Misamis Oriental Rural Electric Service Cooperative (MORESCO) to design and construct facilities for transmitting and distributing electricity.  Audit report covers the period 8/31/68-10/31/70 and is based on document review, and discussions with project officials. As of 9/30/70, $1,034,911 of the $1.1 million loan has been committed or disbursed. Financial support for the project from A.I.D. and the Republic of the Philippines (RP) is considered inadequate due to inflation and devaluation of the RP peso, and to added costs derived from closer defining of project requirements.  Although the project was revised to incorporate these additional costs, there remains a shortfall of $227,634 and 905,481 RP pesos, which is expected to be covered by A.I.D., the Development Bank of the Philippines, and the National Electrification Administration. Possible project delays caused by residents' refusal to permit coconut trees to be cut down is being handled by personal persuasion, exercising the right of eminent domain to condemn land, and diverting lines where necessary.",,,,"Harrison, Francis M.",,23,M,Audit Report,,,,,,,,9/21/1982 12:00:00 AM,,9/23/1982 12:00:00 AM,11/8/1982 12:00:00 AM,11/8/1982 12:00:00 AM,10/6/1982 12:00:00 AM,14 Dec 1970,1970-12,,,11/2/1982 12:00:00 AM,,10/15/1982 12:00:00 AM,Electrification|Rural areas|Currencies|Devaluation|inflation|Financial resources|Limited data,,Philippines,,PD-AAJ-408,,,,,False,F|E,,184 KB,PDF,,492,Philippines,,Limited data,001485,USAID.

163716,"The theory that improving the nutritional status of mothers and infants lowers fertility rates has been divided into several hypotheses concerning the effects on fertility of nutrition interventions in family planning (FP) programs. This report uses a modified systems analysis approach to test these hypotheses in India and Pakistan in terms of such variables as numbers of births and deaths, nutritional levels, and numbers of FP acceptors. The nine hypotheses tested commonly assumed that improved infant and maternal nutrition increases infant survival and decreases the number of children desired; that providing food supplements at FP clinics increases the number of clients; and that decreased infant mortality resulting from improved maternal nutrition lengthens the birth interval, thus reducing birth rates. Test results were as follows: (1) declines in infant mortality precede declines in birth rates by as little as 10-20 years; (2) FP is used when desired family size is achieved and the survival of at least one male is assured (except if a woman experiences the death of her own child); (3) malnutrition affects up to 50% of the people, primarily infants and preschoolers; (4) high infant and child mortality is partially due to poor maternal and child nutrition; (5) malnutrition lowers fecundity by increasing fetal wastage and infant mortality; (6) nutrition interventions motivate persons to visit FP centers only when actual family size approaches desired family size; and (7) a decrease in mortality at ages 0-4 years does not significantly increase population growth for 20 years; after which the rapid population growth rate, due to high numbers of persons entering their reproductive years, is offset by a reduction in total fertility rates. Recommendations based on these results include combining nutrition interventions with sanitation and child health programs; establishing experimental nutrition interventions for children aged 4-18 months; and collecting baseline data on factors such as changes in death rates by age and cause and in fertility rates by age and child mortality experiences. A seminar on the most current findings is also recommended. A 75-item bibliography (1945-70) is appended.",,,9:2,"RULISON, M.

163717,"What role can health services (HS) play in the Near East-South Asia regions to optimally fulfill family planning (FP) objectives? It is speculated that combining FP and general HS programs can have two principal advantages: making FP services more accessible and cost-effective can increase the number of FP recipients; and decreases in infant mortality can reduce desired and actual family size over the long run. This report presents the results of a study of 11 hypotheses on the use of HS as a tool for promoting FP after the hypotheses were tested in three different models: a health effects model describing the effects of improved health on fertility behavior; a delivery systems model determining the best allocation of FP funds among potential HS programs; and a decision model representing the optimal sequence of decisions to be made relative to the budget allocation among several programs. The hypotheses tested included: that there is an important relationship between increased HS expenditures and decreased mortality; that HS clients are effective contraceptors; that the anonymity provided by an HS program enhances the adoption of contraceptive techniques; and that favourable attitudes toward FP result from its inclusion in an HS program. The major test conclusion drawn was that the data for the health effects model were more complete and appropriate than for the second and third models, for which these data were inadequate to generate any absolute conclusions. Recommendations based on these conclusions are: to conduct a complete information search for the health effects model in those areas not previously examined; to develop the decision model (but not the delivery systems model) utilizing professional opinion to augment the available data; and to conduct a series of experiments using the decision model, data, and professional opinion to determine the sensitivity of this model to data variation and the optimal sequences of decisions for various environmental conditions. A 191-reference bibliography (1955-70), a 100-item list of footnotes, and a structural model and objective function are attached.",,,9:2,"Kennedy, F.

173625,"AS OF 6/30/70/, THE PROJECT HAS UNQUESTIONABLY SUCCEEDED IN ASSISTING THE GOCR IN ESTABLISHING THE STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONS IT NEEDS TO ACHIEVE AN ADEQUATE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE GENERAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENTS INVOLVING ADVICE IN ADMINISTRATION, CURRICULUM, AND PLANNING WERE TERMINATED IN FY'70. THE EDUCATION OFFICER'S  POSITION WILL BE ABOLISHED AND ONLY THE ELEMENTARY TEXTBOOK ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE. THE PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO PHASE OUT IN FY'72. CLEARLY, COSTA RICA WILL WIPE OUT ILLITERACY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY PROVIDING A COMPLETE SIX-YEAR ELEMENTARY EDUCATION FOR ALL SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN AND WILL SPEED UP THE PROCESS WITH ITS NIGHT SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL ADULT LITERACY PROGRAMS. THE OVERALL ELEMENTARY EDUCATION SITUATION IS AS FOLLOWS: ENOUGH TEACHERS ARE BEING PRODUCED THROUGH THE SYSTEM OF NORMAL SCHOOLS TO STAFF ALL OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY; SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION HAS IMPROVED, AND WILL IMPROVE EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF ADVANCED SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE COURSES TO BE PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF COSTA RICA; A MORE FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM IS BEING DEVELOPED AND APPLIED; AND GOOD TEXTBOOKS ARE BEING PROVIDED THROUGH THE ODECA/ROCAP REGIONAL ELEMENTARY TEXTBOOK PROGRAM FOR ALL CHILDREN OF ALL SIX GRADES IN THE FIVE BASIC AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM. THE WEAKNESSES REMAINING ARE THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT CLASSROOMS AND THE NEED FOR MORE SUPPLEMENTARY TEACHING AND LEARNING MATERIALS AND AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT. AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL, INCLUDING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, THE PROBLEM IS MORE DIFFICULT AND WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO RESOLVE. HOWEVER, THE SUPERIOR NORMAL SCHOOL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND, TOGETHER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF COSTA RICA, WILL BE PRODUCING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN ABOUT TWO YEARS. PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE BEGINNING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF EDUCATION THROUGH THE PURCHACE OF CONSTRUCTION BONDS.

174494,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO ESTABLISH THE SUPERIOR INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT (ISG), A GRADUATE BUSINESS SCHOOL WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF TUNIS, TUNSIA, AS OF 6/1/70. THE STATUTE CREATING ISG HAS BEEN ISSUED, A DIRECTOR HAS BEEN APPOINTED, AND IN THE FALL OF 1969 THE ISG BEGAN THE FIRST YEAR OF ITS 2-YEAR MBA PROGRAM WITH 30 STUDENTS SELECTED FROM AMONG 100 HIGHLY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS (1) PROVIDED 2 TECHNICIANS TO TEACH IN THE MBA PROGRAM AND TO ASSIST WITH EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT SEMINARS AND (2) SUPERVISED THE US TRAINING PROGRAMS OF 15 TUNISIAN PARTICIPANTS. PROBLEMS CONCERNING CONTRACT OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD AND CAMPUS BACKSTOPPING HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. ALTHOUGH USAID BELIEVES THAT THE CONTRACT TEAM COULD HAVE PLAYED A STRONGER ROLE IN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE IN A BROADER INSTITUTION BUILDING FRAMEWORK, NEVERTHELESS, THEY HAVE MET THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR POSITIONS. WITH THE REPLACEMENT OF PRESENT STAFF WITH 3 NEW BUT SENIOR U OF I PERSONNEL, PLUS THE EXPERIENCE GAINED THIS YEAR, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. ATTENDANCE AT SEMINARS AND SHORT COURSES FOR MANAGERS HAS BEEN AVERAGING 16 PEOPLE PER SEMINAR AND THE NUMBER OF SEMINARS PER YEAR WILL PROBABLY STABILIZE AT AROUND 10. DR KHEMAKHEM, THE US-EDUCATED DIRECTOR OF THE ISG, HAS ALSO BEEN APPOINTED AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PRODUCTIVITY (INP). THIS HAS RESULTED IN CLOSER COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CONSULTING ACTIVITIES AND EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF THE INP AND THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM AT ISG. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENT WILL LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE CAN DEVOTE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ISG AND HE MAY HAVE TO DISCONTINUE TEACHING. THIS MAY PRESENT A PROBLEM SINCE ONLY ONE OTHER QUALIFIED TUNISIAN IS AVAILABLE AT PRESENT TO FILL THE MINIMUM 3 POSITIONS FOR TUNISIAN TEACHERS. FINALLY, THE EVALUATOR NOTES THAT FY 1970 HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR ALL TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT PLANS AND PROGRAMS DUE TO MAJOR SHIFTS IN POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PERSONNEL THAT TOOK PLACE.",Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1969-1 Jun 1970,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,5/19/1978 12:00:00 AM,,5/19/1978 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,29 Jun 1970,1970-06,,,,,,Institution building|Seminars|Faculty|Universities and colleges|Business enterprises|Management|Management training|Graduate education|Management education,,Tunisia,,PD-AAC-038-A1,,,,,False,P|E,,682 KB,PDF,,664,Tunisia,,Onsite evaluation|Limited data,008616,USAID.
