169283,"Grant is provided to improve the administrative capability of the the Government of Paraguay (GOP).  Project consists of four subprojects. Subproject three will improve GOP's accounting procedures and budget control. Project will be carried out in conjunction with a UN Development Program (UNDP) project in fiscal accounting and budget control, and the UNDP senior advisor will act as project leader.  GOP will provide in-kind facilities and counterpart technicians. Realization of the project purpose is essential if the GOP is to have a stable fiscal situation and the capacity to support foreign lending programs needed for Paraguayan development.  To this end, a revised budget law and a new accounting law will be prepared and enacted. Based on this new legislation, new accounting systems will be installed in major GOP ministries, a centralized disbursing office will be established in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Central Budget Office will be reorganized, the budget classification system will be revised, and budget receipts and expenditures will be codified.  In addition, training and training procedures will be institutionalized, including instruction at the National University In-Service Training Center (see Project 526001804) and on-the-job training for counterparts designated by MOF.

ALTHOUGH COMPARING UNFAVORABLY WITH ORIGINAL & REVISED SCHEDULES (98%  & 83%),IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A SERIOUS SETBACK. A FINANCIAL SLUMP IN 1967,A US DOCK STRIKE,CHANGES IN EQUIPMENT ALLOCATION,AND DELAYS IN LOCAL PROCUREMENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL DELAY.

THE AUDITORS NOTE THAT THE CONSULTANT CONTRACT PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES,AT THE RATE OF 100% OF DIRECT LABOR INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED 10% PROFIT FACTOR. SUCH A PROVISION PROVIDES LITTLE INCENTIVE TO KEEP COSTS LOW;AND IS NOT CURRENTLY ALLOWABLE IN US GOVT CONTRACTING.

LARGE NUMBERS OF DIVERSIFIED PROJS IN EDUCATN, HEALTH, AGR, ENGINEERING, COOP, ETC HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH CONSIDERABLE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMT (CONTRIBUTNS AVERAGE 68% PER PROJ). MANY PEASANTS HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF MEANINGFUL ASSIST FROM GOB & HOW TO OBTAIN IT.

THE STRENGTHENING OF GOB'S ECON & SOCIO-POLITICAL STRUCTURE HAS PRODUCED A MORE STABLE RURAL POP & PROFITABLE SELF-HELP ACTIVITIES. PROJ HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE PUBLICITY IN BOLIVIAN NEWSPAPERS (ABOUT 100 ARTICLES PER MO) AND ON BOLIVIAN TELEVISN STATNS (CD ACTIVITIES REPORTED DAILY). FURTHER, PROJ HAS REVEALED THAT SELF-HELP METHODS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO AID THE RURAL POP.

There is considerable questioning of an institution which appears to be developing key opposition leaders. The Municipal Regional Training Courses were concluded.  A proposal for a new series has been presented to the Association Board for approval.  The Natl Budget Office, INFOM (National Municipal Promotion Institute) and INAD have jointly developed a Budget Administration Course for municipal treasurers. Fifteen local officials are currently participating.  Consultant services are also being provided to the National Tourist Office (INGUAT). The Civil Service Classification and Pay Plan was approved by the Executive despite much opposition.  Some half million quetzales necessary to implement the program will be included in the budget. Approximately 1500 employees have been certified into the Civil Service System.  Also about 120 personnel management decisions a week are being processed for operating ministeries and agencies in conformance with the law & governing regulations.

175710,"Reports on USAID assistance from 10/1/69-10/31/69 to improve tax administration in Guatemala.  An IRS Tax Collections advisor came on board 10/2 and began his study of the GOG's administrative problems in collecting delinquent accounts. Coordination of the Tax Administration Reform was transferred to the National Planning Council by order of the Minister of Finance.  The US Tax Advisor has been assigned to the direct tax area -- income tax, property tax, inheritance and gift taxes. Funds were included in the GOG 1970 budget for another court of ""Economico Co-Activo"" to collect delinquent accounts and/or seize assets for tax sales.  Two reports were prepared for the Minister of Finance with respect to the exoneration of warehousing fees and property tax penalties.  A system for administrative collection was developed in draft form which contemplates contacting delinquent taxpayers and persuading them to pay prior to initiating legal action.  The system will be implemented on a pilot basis.  Two collectors will be hired on a contract basis and will use motorcycles to maximize contacts with delinquent taxpayers.  An organization study was made of the Direccion General de Rentas which currently consists of 16 sections or other components reporting directly to the chief of the office.  The proposed reorganization chart includes only four divisions -- Administration, Audit, Collections and Land Tax.

THE REVISED PRO/AG (5/8/69) EXPANDED THE BUREC TEAM TO INCLUDE EXPERTS IN HYDROLOGY, LAND CLASSIFICATION & GROUNDWATER ENGINEERING. BUREC PROJ MANAGER FREQUENTLY CONSULTED WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE UPPER PAMPANGA RIVER PROJ (WORLD BANK) WITH RESPECT TO MAPPING PROJ LANDS & LAND CLASSIFICATION. ADDITIONAL TECH ASSIST FROM THE BUREC TEAM HAS BEEN REQUESTED. WORK ON A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE BALINTINGON RESERVOIR SITE WAS SUSPENDED DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN ESTABLISHING HORIZONTAL & VERTICAL CONTROLS AT THAT SITE. HOWEVER,BY MEANS OF NEW TECHNIQUES,IT IS PROPOSED TO HAVE THE MAP COMPILED USING AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY ALREADY AVAILABLE. A DRAFT SPECIFICATION WAS PREPARED FOR A REVERSE CIRCULATION ROTARY RIG -- A TYPE OF RIG WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE DIAMETER IRRIGATION WELLS. PURCHASE OF THE RIG WILL COME FROM AN NIA EQUIPMENT LOAN (APPROX $125,000 FOR A COMBINATION DIRECT/REVERSE RIG). SPECIFICATIONS WERE PREPARED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF 5 SHALLOW PRODUCTION TEST & DEMONSTRATION WELLS. DURING EARLIER TESTS IN THE BALOC AREA,ONE LANDOWNER INSTALLED CENTRIFUGAL (SUCTION) PUMPS ON 3 TEST BORINGS. AS A RESULT ENOUGH WATER WAS PROVIDED FOR A GOOD RICE CROP IN A LIMITED AREA. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH IMPACT COSTS,THE BUREC TEAM IS ATTEMPTING TO INTEREST LOCAL FIRMS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF WELL SCREENS & CASINGS. STUDIES AT BALOG-BALOG DAMSITE SHOWED PUMP-BACK STORAGE TO BE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE METHOD TO GENERATE PEAKING POWER. ALSO,AN INVENTORY OF PROJ LANDS IS BEING CONTINUED & ALTERNATE SPILLWAY DESIGNS EVALUATED. WATER SUPPLY STUDIES FOR THE PROJ HAVE INDICATED THAT YR-ROUND IRRIGATION MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 20,000 TO 25,000 HECTARES. PROCUREMENT WAS NOT A REGULAR FUNCTION OF THE BUREC TEAM.

173756,"EVALUATES TECH ASPECTS OF THE DIRECTED CREDIT PROGRAM (DCP) OF THE NATL FEDERATION OF CREDIT & SAVINGS COOPERATIVES (HEREINAFTER THE FEDERATION) IN ECUADOR FROM 6/1/67-6/1/69. USAID ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED TO THE DCP TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH THE DEVLPMNT OF RURAL AGRI CREDIT UNIONS. INFO FOR THE ANALYSIS WAS COLLECTED FROM RECORDS OF THE COOPERATIVE BANK OF ECUADOR & A SURVEY OF CREDIT UNION MANAGERS CONDUCTED IN 5/69. STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE DCP REALIZED SUBSTANTIAL SUCCESS IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH 26 CREDIT UNIONS ESTABLISHED OR REVITALIZED IN 4 1/2 YRS. HOWEVER,THE EVAL NOTES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR ITS SUCCESS WAS THE AMT OF MONEY SPENT. AS OF 12/31/68, USAID MADE GRANTS TOTALLING $125,000 COVERING DCP'S ADMIN EXPENSES & THE COST OF CUNA (CREDIT UNION NATL ASSOC) TECHNICIANS. IN ADDITION, $650,000 OF A USAID LOAN TO THE ECUADOR CO-OP BANK WAS USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE DCP. STUDY DESIGNATES THE FAILURE OF THE FEDERATION TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TECH ASSISTANCE TO THE DCP CREDIT UNIONS AS THE MOST SERIOUS SHORTCOMING. STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT THE FEDERATION ASSIGN ADDITIONAL AGRONOMISTS OR OTHER AGRI EXPERTS TO THE PROG; ALSO, THAT THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING CREDIT UNIONS BE REDUCED TO APPROX 5. THIS REDUCTION IS REQUIRED TO CUT COSTS & IMPROVE PROG ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS TO INCREASE THE AMT OF SUPERVISION & TECH ASSIST AVAILABLE TO THE CREDIT UNIONS. ALL 6 URBAN ORIENTED CREDIT UNIONS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROG. STUDY CONCLUDES THAT INSTITUTION-BUILDING (INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DCP CREDIT UNIONS) WAS EMPHASIZED OVER PROG QUALITY TO A DETRIMENTAL DEGREE. THE STRESS ON QUANTIFIABLE GOALS MAY BE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF CUNA INTNATL WHICH USES STATISTICAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE LA CREDIT UNION MOVEMENT.

172557,"Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) is established to improve, through applied and adaptive research, the nutritional quality, productivity, and availability of vegetables and vegetable products in participating countries. This entails increasing the availability of vitamins, proteins, fats, and oils from vegetable sources to the populations of these countries.  Overall functions of the Center include research, extension training, and study of production, processing, storage, and marketing techniques.  Center staff is composed of experts from participating countries as well as from countries outside the region, such as the United States. Grant agreement of 9/27/93 to support AVRDC efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)/Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) to assist the National Agriculture Research System (NARS) in improving vegetable production.  To this end, AVRDC will provide the services of a resident senior horticulturist/agronomist for a period of 24 months.  The specialist will work in collaboration with BARC/BARI/NARS, vegetable growers, NGOs, and private entrepreneurs, with special emphasis on introducing germplasm, developing adaptive technologies, and transferring mature technologies to farmers' fields.  The specialist will also assist and coordinate linkages between AVRDC and NARS.  In addition, AVRDC will provide services of short-term specialists.

169014,"Grant is provided to the Government of Tunisia (GOT) to relieve protein, calorie, and vitamin deficiencies in the diets of pre-school children through the use of U.S. PL 480 Title II agricultural commodities. The project is part of an ongoing A.I.D. provision of PL 480 foods for needy Tunisian children. A pre-school feeding program will be carried out in 320 municipal centers throughout the country.  A total of 170,000 pre-school children will be offered morning snacks at these centers.  These children, who will range in age from three to six, will be chosen on the basis of individual need by a group of responsible community officials.  Each child will be given a ration card and each morning this card will be checked in order that it is used only once per day. Foodstuffs to be supplied include flour, milk, oil, and butter.  The flour will be turned over to local bakers who will bake the bread for daily consumption.  A central warehouse for project commodities will be constructed. It is proposed that wheat be imported instead of flour in order that the Ministry of Youth and Sports and Social Affairs, who will administer the program, will also have the facilities of the Office of Cereals (OOC) at its disposal.  The OOC will act as an exchange and transportation agency to prevent warehousing and transportation obstacles from occurring. The U.S. Government will make efforts to convince the GOT of the priority need for this program and of the need to institutionalize a permanent program of pre-school feeding.",,,,"SMITH, LANGDON S.",,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,3/7/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,14 Apr 1969,1969-04,,,,,,CHILD NUTRITION|Food aid programs|Food for Peace|Deficiency diseases,,Tunisia,,PD-AAF-255-B1,,,,,False,E,,827 KB,PDF,,664,Tunisia,,,008616,USAID.

168956,"Grant is provided to improve public administration within the Government of Paraguay (GOP).  Project consists of four subprojects. Subproject one will improve GOP's tax administration.  Project will be administered by USAID/Paraguay, which will coordinate its activities closely with Organization of American States' (OAS) tax assistance in the field of tax legislation and policy. Substantially improved systems and procedures in tax administration will be developed and institutionalized. This will be accomplished through three component tasks:  (1) preparation of written manuals detailing procedures, forms, document processing methods, position descriptions and functions, etc.; (2) organization and institutionalization of in-service and participant training programs for Ministry of Finance (MOF) technical and administrative personnel; and (3) development of a centralized planning function for reviewing procedures, forms, and personnel and finance budgets. Specific areas of attention will include audit activities, appeals, filing charges, updating taxpayer and property records, property tax assessment, delinquent balance and routine collection procedures, and document/data handling and processing.  The new system and procedures should assure a sharp increase in the voluntary compliance of the Paraguayans with the nation's tax laws. Improvement of taxpayer awareness of tax regulations and procedures, distribution of computational sales tax tables, and the issuing of official receipts to taxpayers will also contribute to this objective.

THE PROJECT COMPONENTS WILL INCLUDE TRAINING PROGRAMS, ESTABLISHING A CENTRAL COMMAND FACILITY, MODERNIZING A POLICE LABORATORY AND IDENTIFICATION BUREAU, AND CREATING A NATIONAL TRAINING ACADEMY. TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE BOTH LOCALLY AND IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 20,000 POLICE OFFICERS. A UNIFIED COMMAND CENTER WILL BE LOCATED IN THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT POLICE WHICH PLACES REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MILITARY AND POLICE AGENCIES IN THE SAME OPERATIONS ROOM. A POLICE LABORATORY AND CRIMINAL RECORDS AND IDENTIFICATION BUREAU WILL BE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE. A NATIONAL ACADEMY WILL BE CREATED TO TRAIN VARIOUS POLICE GROUPS IN ONE CENTRAL LOCATION. THE GOV WILL FINANCE INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION FOR THE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS. IT WILL ALSO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT SUCH AS FIREARMS, VEHICLES AND COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES. VENEZUELA HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE ORGANIZATIONS, RESPONSIBLE TO A VARIETY OF MINISTRIES. CITIES AND STATES HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE FORCES WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PREFECTS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOV WILL BREAK DOWN THE OPERATIONAL AUTONOMY OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. HOWEVER, IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE POLICE CONSOLIDATION, BUT THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO PASS SUCH LEGISLATION AS THE CURRENT GOV ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OF CONGRESS.

169235,"Loan is provided to the Home Loan Department of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to enable it to continue its program of financing guaranteed loan investments through credit institutions for non-subsidized homes for Central American middle-income families.  Loan extends the 1963 A.I.D. loan which provided seed capital to CABEI's Home Loan Department.  CABEI will lend to eligible institutions on a regional basis while emphasizing self-help and low sales price ceilings.  Loan utilization procedures will be as follows: (1) CABEI and A.I.D. will agree on and publicize a list of eligible institutions, terms, and conditions of the investment guarantee.  (2) CABEI will activate an Advisory Commitee to collect and review material on housing need and supply, income levels, structures, and saving potentials of home building institutions, construction costs, and the availability of building material and labor.  On the basis of its findings, the Committee will formulate a structure for CABEI's Loan Department and principles for loan implementation.  (3) CABEI will receive and review applications for stand-by commitments in excess of $100,000. (4) On the basis of its staff review and after considering all policy recommendations of the Advisory Committee, CABEI will either issue a stand-by commitment or reject the application.  (5) On receipt of a CABEI stand-by commitment, local institutions will issue their own commitments to local builders.  Upon completion of the dwelling units, the local institution will complete disbursement of its own (mortage) funds, and will then exercise its right to sell CABEI the agreed participation in the mortages.  (6) CABEI will complete the related borrowing under the loan agreement and will lend the necessary dollars to the respective Central Banks, simultaneously borrowing local money from the latter for dispersal to the originating institution. (7) CABEI will also design a mortage bond issue and will agree to issue mortage bonds in increments to be agreed upon between CABEI and A.I.D., to supplement the housing investment guaranty proceeds and provide reserve liquidity.",,,,,,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,5/20/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,25 Jul 1969,1969-07,,,,,,Institution building|CREDIT|HOUSING|Financial institutions|HOUSING CREDIT|Housing investment guaranty,,Central America,,PD-AAB-994,,,,,False,F|E,,"9,118 KB",PDF,,596z,Reg Office Cent America & Panama (ROCAP),,,002485,USAID.

175111,"First Project Appraisal Review of Rural Health Project in cooperation with Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) of Thai Government (RTG). Project designed to strengthen rural health dvlp in form of better trained health personnel, facilities & supplies, particularly in areas of NE Thailand threatened by insurgency.  An outgrowth of project 4930109, it is supported by subprojects 4930179.1 (Mobile Medical Team Support) & 4930179.2 (Protein Food Dvlp). PAR as of 5/1/69 judges project to be on-schedule with good performance & effectiveness of implementation.  The basic training of health auxiliary workers is on-schedule, with half assigned to facilities in sensitive provinces.  In-service training programs are expanding.  Of 176 participant trainees, 108 are now serving in rural areas.  46% of the 389 new health centers established since 1966 are in the NE.  More than half of the 12,000 designated environmental health dvlp villages are in the NE; wells, piped water supplies, and water seal latrines have been constructed. The project has strengthened the organizational/admin structure within MOPH for prioritizing delivery of services to rural dvlp provinces; a health planning section has been established in the undersecretary's office. Behind schedule are the dvlp of a rural health research project (now underway), staffing of newly-constructed health facilities & construction of training institutions. Participant training is deterred by lack of English proficiency.  Commodity control problems & spare parts shortages are being straightened-out.  RTG budgeting for support services/facilities inadequate.  Unwillingness to relocate to rural areas & inadequate compensation have affected personnel availability. Project hampered by traditional admin patterns & lack of coordination between ministries/departments; but marked improvement in dvlp of planning/mgmt skills evident. Increase in emphasis on dvlp of health planning capability at national/prov levels:  greater delegation to prov health officers; better coordination within MOPH and with other RTG related activities.",,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/12/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/12/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1 May 1969,1969-05,,,,,,Health care planning|Health policy|SANITATION|Counterinsurgency|High protein foods|Nursing education|Mobile health services|Paramedical education|Primary health care|Health workers|Clinics|Health education|Participants|Rural areas|Health care|Health outreach services|Integrated health care|Medical education|Health delivery|Limited data plus,,Thailand,,PD-AAD-620-F1,,,,,False,E,,781 KB,PDF,,493,Thailand,,Counterinsurgency (COIN),008613,USAID.

EDUCATIONAL EFFECTS, EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND PROJECT ADMINISTRATION, COSTS AND MANPOWER UTILIZATION, AND SOCIAL EFFECTS ARE EXAMINED. THE CONTRACTOR, ACADEMY FOR EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, HAS CONCENTRATED ON TESTING STUDENT LEARNING, WITH SECONDARY ATTENTION TO ATTITUDE STUDIES AND COLLECTION OF MATERIAL FOR CASE STUDY RECORD. OTHER STUDIES BEGIN LATER IN PROJECT. 3 GROUPS ARE STUDIED: 1. CLASSES RECEIVING NEW CURRICULUM VIA TV AND HAVING RETAINED TEACHERS; 2. CLASSES OTHERWISE IDENTICAL, BUT WITHOUT TV; 3. CLASSES FROM TRADITIONAL SYSTEM. TESTS ARE DEVELOPED AND ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR TO 1800 SEVENTH GRADERS IN 3 SUBJECTS; ATTITUDES, GENERAL ABILITY AND READING SKILL, PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITY, ABSTRACT THINKING ABILITY (TO SUBGROUP OF 600) ARE MEASURED. MATH TEACHING IS INTENSIVELY STUDIED DURING SCHOOL YEAR.

169553,"Grant is provided to the Government of Bolovia to distribute titles of land ownership to 300,000-350,000 rural families by 6/75.  The project will be implemented by the National Agrarian Reform Service, a semi-autonomous public agency. The Mobile Unit pilot project, presently operating with six units of agrarian judges and topographers who determine property rights and distribute titles to peasant families, will be expanded to 18 units. The units will be instrumental in resolving 8,000 pending cases of land expropriation and distributing titles to 200,000-225,000 peasant families, landlords who have retained part of their property, and l00,000-l25,000 families living in freeholding communities (i.e., where land is owned in the name of the community).  Mobile units will be deployed based on the number of requests for their services, the gravity of an area's tenure problems and land conflicts, the area's importance in the proposed wheat and wool programs, and the area's accesibility. Field work will be organized in conjunction with community development programs, agricultural extension offices, and peasant organizations. Computers will be rented and modern registry and certification services will be implemented to speed the drawing-up and issuing of titles. USAID will issue a monthly publication and broadcast short Aymara- and Quechua-language radio spots to inform the rural population of available development institutions and services.  The 8-10,000 landlords who retain part of their previous holdings will be encouraged to sell out or to work their land more intensively.  The project will result in security for peasants, promote capital improvements, increase access to credit, and facilitate rural development programs.",,,,"CLARK, R.|KOLAR, PETER",,14,M,Other Authorized Design Document,,,,,,,,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1/12/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,26 May 1969,1969-05,,,3/23/1983 12:00:00 AM,,,LAND REFORM|Public land records|Land development|Cadasters|Mobile units|Land tenure,,Bolivia,,PD-AAH-446-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,730 KB",PDF,,511,Bolivia,,,008515,USAID.

The survey was begun in the spring of 1967 under the leadership of Senator Wayne Morse, then chairman of the subcommittee.  The complexities involved in this last study prevented its publication during the 90th Congress.  The study reviews the U.S. foreign assistance program in a single country, Colombia, in the hope that such a review in some depth might shed more light on the problems of aid than could be derived from a more superficial study of aid in all of Latin America.  Colombia was selected as the subject country because the aid program there is large enough to be significant but small enough to present a feasible target for detailed study, and also because it involves most of the problems which the United States encounters in carrying out aid programs elsewhere in the hemisphere.

176771,"Evaluates project to assist the Philippine Police Commission (POLCOM) develop better law enforcement capabilities in the areas of basic police skills, police communications, and law enforcement commodities and techniques. Evaluation covers the period from project inception in 1957 to 1/31/69. Evaluation is based in part on a review of project documents. Three of seven targeted regional training centers have been constructed, and construction of the other four is underway. Development of training programs in both basic and advanced areas of police skills is 80% complete.  The basic police science, criminal investigation, basic senior officers', and instructors' courses are now completed and certified for use by POLCOM.  Half of the instructional staff, consisting of prior U.S.-trained Filipino police personnel, is trained and on board.  The preparation of training aids and manuals is just beginning.  To date, training has been provided in basic police science to 600 and in specialized areas to 164 participants. In-service training of graduates and training of supervisors will be deferred until 60% of those targeted for the basic police science program have been trained.  Basic training has been provided to 1,100 of 1,400 senior officers targeted. Efforts at interdepartmental cooperation have been enhanced by the Community Police Improvement Program. In Rizal Province, two cities have been added to the original five for this program and further additions are planned.  Major progress has been made in establishing a centralized record system, but criminalistics and the compilation of statistical information could be improved. The establishment of a single nationwide law enforcement teletype network and integrated law enforcement communications system are behind schedule, although most individual activities are on target. High-level financial and philosophic support exists for the project. At the same time, POLCOM's failure to comply fully with the terms of the Project Agreement, and its limited outreach capability have created commodity distribution problems.",Evaluation period: 1 Jan1957-31 Jan1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,31 Jan 1969,1969-01,,,,,,Police|Communications technology|Police services|Public administration|Vocational training|Indigenous education,,Philippines,,PD-AAH-190-D1,,,,,False,F|E,,"4,350 KB",PDF,,492,Philippines,,Onsite evaluation|Limited data,008592,USAID.

DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS RECRUITING OF LAO EXTENSION AGENTS LEVELED OFF IN FY'68 AND EMPHASIS WAS DIRECTED TO IMPROVING SKILLS THROUGH PRACTICAL IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FARM DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. IN FY'68, PARTICIPANT TRAINING TARGETS WERE REVISED, EMPHASIZING DEGREE TRAINING. SHORT OUT-OF-COUNTRY OBSERVATION TOURS WERE ELIMINATED IN FY'69 BECAUSE IN-COUNTRY TRAINING WAS MORE EFFECTIVE. PRESENT FY'69 STAFFING LEVEL IS 197 PERSONNEL. THE LAO GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING THE SALARIES OF 102 AGENTS AND USAID FUNDS THE REMAINING 95 SALARIES. AGENTS REACH ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE FARMERS IN THEIR AREA BUT IN SOME AREAS THE SECURITY SITUATION SHARPLY CURTAILS EFFECTIVENESS. ONLY 2% OF THE AGENTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, HOWEVER, PRACTICAL ON-THE-JOB TRAINING HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN COMPENSATING FOR THIS. LOW SALARY LEVELS (AVERAGING $15 A MONTH) FAIL TO ENCOURAGE QUALITY PERFORMANCE. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY, THE INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTARY SERVICE, HAS 27 PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION MAKING NOTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER, MANY VOLUNTEERS DO LACK TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE IN RICE PRODUCTION. THE EXTENSION EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE. WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS, SOME FARMERS HAVE INCREASED YIELDS 7 TIMES AND MANY 4 TO 5-FOLD. THE EXTENSION SERVICE ENCOURAGED FARMER ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS BY CONDUCTING RICE PADDY FIELD DEMONSTRATIONS AND THROUGH TECHNICAL ADVICE. DRY SEASON RICE PRODUCTION WAS ALSO INTRODUCTED, USING SUPPLEMENTAL WATERS AND NON-PHOTOSENSITIVE SEEDS. INTENSIVE 6-DAY CROP AND FISH PRODUCTION TRAINING COURSES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED FOR FARMER/LEADERS THROUGHOUT LAOS SINCE FY'68. THE COURSE OBJECTIVE IS TO TAP VOLUNTARY VILLAGE LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PROGRAM. THE HOME ECONOMICS PROGRAM HAS BEEN REDESIGNED TO INCLUDE A)TEACHING VILLAGE WOMEN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF RICE AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION INCLUDING FERTILIZERS, AND INSECTICIDES, AND B)PROCESSING FOODS FROM NEW CROP VARIETIES AND PERISHABLES FOR OUT-OF-SEASON USE.",Evaluation period: Through 1 Jan 1969,,,"MANN, CHARLES A.",,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,AIDC-1756,,,,11/28/1978 12:00:00 AM,,11/28/1978 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,28 Jan 1969,1969-01,,,,6/14/1984 12:00:00 AM,,Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Limited data plus,Participants|Crop production|Rice|Seeds|Farmer training|Household management|Fertilizer distribution,Laos,,PD-AAD-412-G1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,494 KB",PDF,,439,Laos,,Limited data plus,008567,USAID.

THE MAIN THRUST OF THE PROJ WAS TO ESTABLISH SMALL & MEDIUM INDUSTRIES BASED UPON LOCAL COMMERCIAL AGRI & LIVESTOCK RESOURCES. STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE (SRI) PROVIDED 13 FULL-TIME ADVISORS & 13 SHORT-TERM SPECIALISTS TO PERUVIAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS FROM 1963 TO 1967. AN UNREALISTIC ESTIMATE OF AVAILABLE LOCAL RESOURCES -- NATURAL, HUMAN & INSTITUTIONAL -- PROVED TO BE A SERIOUS HANDICAP IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROJ. PROJ TARGETS WERE REVISED DURING A CONTRACT EXTENSION IN 1965 & SHORT-TERM SERVICES WERE REMOVED FROM THE SRI CONTRACT. IN 1966, THERE WERE FURTHER REVISIONS & THE FULL-TIME STAFF WAS REDUCED TO TWO. THE TWO REMAINING ADVISORS WERE ASSIGNED  TO THE NEWLY CREATED SOUTHERN PERU REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICE (ORDESUR), A REGIONAL COORDINATING BODY FOR THE VARIOUS DEVEL CORPORATIONS. AT THE END OF 1967, THE SRI CONTRACT WAS TERMINATED. SRI PROVIDED QUALITY TECHNICIANS IN SOME AREAS, BUT THE PERSONNEL IN REMOTE LOCATIONS (CUZCO & PUNO) PERFORMED POORLY. CURRENT ADVISORS ARE PROVIDED UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE COUNCIL FOR INTNATL PROGRESS IN MANAGEMENT. MOST OF THE PARTICIPATING SOUTHERN PERU DEVEL CORPORATIONS HAD WEAK MGMT & TECH STAFFS,OVER-COMMITMENTS OF FUNDS & LIMITED INDUST POTENTIAL. HOWEVER,THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS ORDESUR A VITAL & VIABLE FACTOR IN THE DEVEL OF SOUTH PERU. TEN FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE COMPLETED BY ORDESUR FROM 1967-68 & TWO NEW INDUSTRIES RESULTED. ORDESUR ALSO INCLUDED A DIVISION OFFERING BUSINESS ADVISORY SERVICES TO SMALL & MEDIUM BUSINESSES. IT IS STAFFED WITH MBA'S FURNISHED BY THE PEACE CORPS & HAS OPERATED WITH REASONABLE SUCCESS. THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT PERU'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN DEPRESSED & THAT ORDESUR SPENT PERHAPS ONE-THIRD OF ITS TIME ATTEMPTING TO RAISE CAPITAL. THE DIFFICULTY OF RECRUITING QUALIFIED US TECHNICIANS FOR LONG-TERM ASSIGNMENTS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS IS ALSO NOTED. THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS USING SHORT-TERM SENIOR & LONG-TERM JUNIOR ADVISORS.

175722,"Presents in-depth analysis of US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tech assistance to Govt of Peru (GOP) under Tax Admin component of USAID's Govt Finance & Admin Proj as of 1/31/69.  Initiated in 1963 with IRS survey, proj has sought to increase central govt revenues while simultaneously beginning to distribute tax burden more equitably. Progress reported to be satisfactory but behind schedule due to incomplete results, discontinuities in the level of GOP response & commitment, and IRS/USAID admin difficulties.  Notable results have been achieved in the establishment & growth of Intelligence Service (enforcement) & Public Info operations.  IRS Intelligence Advisor withdrawn in 1968 with no adverse effect on subsequent operations; the public info unit effectively used communications media to promote proj accomplishments & to educate the public as to its tax-paying obligations during time of tax reform implementation.  USAID Mission estimates that tax admin improvements accounted for 1 billion soles or 17% of the l50% increase in tax revenues from 1963-1968, a sum that is respectable but not of major import given GNP & price increases and the levying of new taxes.  An informed taxpayer appeal procedure put into effect.  Increase in sales tax collections achieved while simultaneously reducing number of inspectors by half. Tax code has been issued; organization & collection manuals have been issued; other manuals awaiting approval. Functional reorganization plan reduced tax office divisions from 17 to 9, but has been largely ignored with number of divisions again growing to 16.  Relatively effective training center abolished by GOP in 1967 because space needed for what proved to be abortive ADP proj. Collection responsibilities reside in independent Banco de la Nacion resulting in admin and coord problems.  Govt priorities have shifted with each new incumbent Finance Minister (5 in 1968), & entrenched interests & tradition prevail over reform.  IRS effectiveness (19 advisors in 5 yrs) hampered by adjustment/lang difficulties.  USAID paid too little attention to proj.

IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WAS TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROGRAM AND A START IN AGR DIVERSIFICATION, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING. THE SERVICES OF AN AGR ECONOMIST AND HIS TEAM WERE CURTAILED PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THEIR FIRST TOUR OF DUTY PRIMARILY DUE TO USAID DISSATISFACTION WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS OF MOST OF THE TEAM; AND PERSONAL HEALTH REASONS. DURING THE PERIOD, A FULL-TIME ENTOMOLOGIST WAS BROUGHT TO NICARAGUA TO DEAL WITH HEALTH AND MARKETING PROBLEMS RELATED TO EXCESSIVE USE OF INSECTICIDES. HIS TOUR OF DUTY WAS CUT SHORT BECAUSE OF FAMILY HEALTH REASONS ALTHOUGH HE AHD BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO USAID ON A TDY BASIS. THE ONLY FULL-TIME USDA TECHNICIAN NOW WORKING IN NICARAGUA IS AN EXTENSION SPECIALIST. PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGR CREDIT (NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS ANTICIPATED BECAUSE OF ITS OVER-SOPHISTICATION); ELIMINATION OF INSECTICIDE-INFECTED MEAT IN SLAUGHTER HOUSES; DEVEL OF NATNL PRGRMS FOR ELIMIN OF MARKETING/HLTH PRBLMS; EXTENSION PRGRMS INVOLVING FULL-TIME PROFESSIONALS.

173640,"AS OF 12/31/68. EVALUATES TAX ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES OVER A SIX-YEAR PERIOD. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN QUITE SATISFACTORY. IMPROVEMENTS IN REVENUE ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN PANAMA'S NATIONAL REVENUE. THE IRS ADVISORS ARE WELL EXPERIENCED AND WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH COUNTERPARTS. HOST COUNTRY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE ADVICE OF TAX TEAM MEMBERS IN VIRTUALLY ALL AREAS OF TEAM ACTIVITY: DATA PROCESSING, AUDIT PROGRAM DESIGN AND TECHNIQUES, COLLECTION TECHNIQUES, TAXPAYER EDUCATION PROGRAMS, ORGANIZATION, AND MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, FREQUENT CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP HAS DISRUPTED PROGRAM PLANS. BASED ON A 1962 ""FISCAL SURVEY OF PANAMA"" CONDUCTED UNDER AUSPICES OF THE OAS AND IDB, THE GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA REVISED THE INCOME TAX SYSTEM IN 12/64. GOP REORGANIZED THE REVENUE DEPARTMENT EFFECTIVE 1/1/69. A NEW ""AUDIT AND CLAINS DIVISION"" WAS ESTABLISHED. AUDITORS WILL FOLLOW THE ""PACKAGE-AUDIT"" PLAN, I.E., INQUIRING INTO ALL TAXES FOR WHICH THE TAXPAYER MAY BE LIABLE - INCOME TAX, WITHHOLDING TAX, EXCISE TAX, BUSINESS LICENSE TAX, ETC. AN APPEALS SYSTEM HAS ALSO BEEN INSTITUTED. AN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY UNIT AND AN INTERNAL AUDIT UNIT WERE ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE AND CORRUPTION. ADP EQUIPMENT WAS INSTALLED AND A MASTER FILE WAS CREATED OF INCOME TAX, BUSINESS LICENSE TAX, AND PROPERTY TAX. MECHANIZATION OF THE PROCESSING, ACCOUNTING, AND TAX BILLING OPERATIONS IS ADVANCING SATISFACTORILY. UNDER NEW DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS PROCEDURES BEING TESTED IN PANAMA CITY, EACH COLLECTION WORKER CAN ISSUE SEVERAL HUNDRED DELINQUENCY NOTICES A DAY COMPARED TO 15 TO 25 PER DAY WITH THE PRIOR MANUAL SYSTEM. THROUGH 12/68, 31 REVENUE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES HAVE PARTICIPATED IN USAID/IRS TRAINING PROGRAMS.

175051,"First Audit Report of 3/30/64-6/72 Agriculture Education Project, whereby AID provides technical support (commodities & University of Wyoming contracted assistance) to Ministry of Education (MOE) of Government of Afghanistan (RGA) and Kabul University.  Project maintains activities in 3 sub-areas: vocational agriculture, Kabul Univ Faculty of Agriculture & Kabul Univ Library; merges/consolidates previous project 3060008 & parts of 3060028, 3060057 and 3060070. Auditors reviewed project documents/reports & conducted discussions with USAID/A officials & contract personnel.  Audited amount of $131,867 for current project funds is exclusive of contracted expenditures (audited separately). Overall progress observed in all 3 sub-areas (though deemed marginally satisfactory in draft PAR shown auditors).  Deficiencies were particularly noted in management/systems.  Vocational Agricultural Education sub-activity terminated 12/66 as planned, with staff upgrading & increasing number of Afghan graduates for Kabul Vocational Agricultural High School, now relocated in Helmand Valley.  MOE has not developed additional voc/agric schools nor availed itself of further proffered assistance.  Kabul Univ Library component upon FY 68 termination transferred to Kabul Univ Administration Improvement Project (3060013).  Kabul Univ Faculty of Agriculture has increased student enrollment with completed facilities. Participant training in agric educ related fields deemed satisfactory for 11 Afghans now employed with MOE.

153456,"Evaluates rural electrification project in India. Evaluation covers the period 1/67-12/68; no methodology is specified. The first three of the project's five phases have been completed on schedule.  The reports and surveys which have been produced are both comprehensive and professionally executed due to an unusual level of competence on the part of the contractor, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) and a high degree of cooperation between NRECA, the ad hoc committee of Government of India (GOI) agencies, and USAID/I. For Phase I, a study of the potential for extending cooperative electric service to unserved villages was submitted 12/66.  For Phases II and III, five Indian states (Gufarat, Mysore, Maharasthra, Uttar Pradesh, and Andra Pradesh) were studied to determine the feasibility of establishing rural electrification cooperatives and to help prepare the requisite technical details and financial arrangements; reports were submitted in late 1967 and early 1968. For Phase IV, a 1969 operational workplan has been signed which calls for the fielding of a U.S. technician to each of the five states and for the nomination of seven participants to be trained by NRECA in the United States. Unexpectedly, the GOI is in the process of establishing a corporation to administer a revolving fund to finance planned electrification activities.",Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1968,,,"Funari, John",,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,10/15/1982 12:00:00 AM,,10/21/1982 12:00:00 AM,11/22/1982 12:00:00 AM,11/22/1982 12:00:00 AM,10/28/1982 12:00:00 AM,10 Feb 1969,1969-02,,,11/19/1982 12:00:00 AM,,10/29/1982 12:00:00 AM,Electrification|Rural areas|Cooperatives|Electric power distribution,,India,,PD-AAJ-407,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,942 KB",PDF,,386,India,,Limited data,008557,USAID.

175566,"Progress Appraisal Report evaluates progress as of 2/15/69 of USAID's Agric Advisory Group (AAG) in assisting the Helmand-Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA) in Afghanistan to increase agric production.  It is estimated that total agric production in the area has doubled since 1952 and that present production could double again in the next decade. AAG's work is coordinated with other HAVA agric activities & with USAID's National Agric Dvlp Proj. Overall performance & effectiveness of proj have been satisfactory. Afghan counterparts assigned & trained; research performed on increasing crop yields; extension service established to reach farmers with new methods & improved practices, and necessary commodities & inputs obtained. USAID assistance in livestock phased out, at least temporarily, due to HAVA's lack of progress in livestock program implementation.  Efforts to correct improper commodity utilization include concentration of goods into central facility. Problems encountered in finding enough participant candidates that can meet language requirement.  One cause of personnel shortage is low pay & allowances.  Mission follow-up on returned participants needs improvement; a systematic program of post-training eval is proposed. Agric statistics not yet available in sufficient quantity or quality to permit satisfactory programming & eval. Success of proj depends on availability of fertilizer; estimated tonnage needed by FY1972 will cost $3 million.  Indirect benefits of successful program will be increased employment, both in agric & in business.  Introd of mechanized farming has changed trad concepts of area farmers; 50 now own tractors; 70 applying to buy them. Eval recommends private (rather than govt) sale of fertilizer, plant protection chemicals, tractors, in order to achieve wider use. Responsible HAVA official should defend budget proposals before Afghan govt.  Eval also recommends increased emphasis on plant breeding to offset possible genetic deterioration. Extension of the proj beyond FY1972 is recommended pending a thorough evaluation & review to redirect the program and to establish revised goals and targets.",Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1955-15 Feb 1969,,,"MCCLURE, P.

175589,"Project Appraisal Report as of 3/19/69 for FY63/FY72 Agric Extension Proj in Thailand.  Proj promotes extension training, crop protection demo activities, linkage to agric research, & expansion and strengthening of Farmers' Clubs with the aim of increasing farm production & income and raising rural living standards in politically-sensitive Changwats of N & NE Thailand. Proj judged to be on schedule with implementation progressing slowly but satisfactorily, with future prognosis very good.  Progress spurred by integration of disparate division extension activities into a new Ministry of Agric (MOA) Agric Extension Dept with energetic, key personnel committed to fieldwork. Demo activities have spread to every Amphoe with great initial success in crop protection and in experimentation with new & improved crop varieties in substitution of the traditional rice crop. Farmers' clubs & associations now consolidated into Farmers' Club Demonstration Centers with extension agent & two home economists assigned to each.  Trng has been provided for farm club leaders; proj success largely due to direct farmer participation in operation of local extension activities in contrast to less-successful past efforts managed from Bangkok.  Integration of research findings with extension services underway with dvlp of Extension Center component of NE Agric Center. Proj continues to require outside assistance, but likely to eventually achieve self-sufficiency.  Proj dvlp slowed by strength of trad farming methods, govt budget constraints, poor procurement system, poor facilities & equipment maintenance, and by time required to find & train extension personnel.  MOA 5-yr goal is 700% increase in extension staff to ratio of 1/1000 farmers. New Extension Dept has dvlpd simple yet adequate accounting & control system replacing disarray preceding consolidation. Developments thus far demonstrate genuine Thai Govt interest, but significant future progress dependent on more vigorous support for dvlp and legalization of farmer organizations and support for marketing, agro-industries, and credit extension through local financial institutions.",Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1962-19 Mar 1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,19 Mar 1969,1969-03,,,,,,Agricultural cooperatives|Farm management|Agricultural technology|Farmer training|Agricultural inputs|Small farms|Agricultural research|Demonstration|Farms|Labor intensive technology|Participants|PESTICIDES|Information dissemination|Fertilizers|Water resources|Natural resource development|Institution building|FARM INCOME|Agricultural production|Agricultural extension|Limited data plus,,Thailand,,PD-AAD-625-B1,,,,,False,,,,,,493,Thailand,,Limited data plus,008613,USAID.

176788,"Evaluates project as of 5/19/69 to improve the Government of Paraguay's (GOP) tax administration.  Evaluation is a supplement to the classified PAR of 1/14/69, and is based on a review of that PAR and of the formal comments which this generated among the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) team advising the GOP. The author, the USAID/Paraguay mission director, believes that most of the differences between the previous PAR as written and the comments it generated are of emphasis and nuance, rather than of substance.  The overall rating of ""satisfactory"" in evaluating the performance of the IRS advisors may understate the contribution of the IRS team, but the rating is designed to evaluate the overall achievement of project targets, and not the quality of the advisory services provided by the IRS.  This rating can and should be raised in the next annual PAR if the ground work accomplished to date, which is just beginning to bear fruit, produces significant results.  The author agrees with comments of the IRS team that it has received much more support from the U.S. Embassy and USAID mission during the last 2 years.  He points out that the IRS team's activities were previously quite limited because it was felt that putting pressures on the GOP in regard to fiscal matters might prejudice the attainment of the political objectives given first priority by the previous Ambassador.  Since the present Ambassador has given far greater emphasis to economic and social objectives, USAID has given top priority to fiscal questions.  The mission director concludes that effective working relations have been established between the IRS team and the Ministry of Finance and other GOP offices, and that this, together with the considerable new GOP tax legislation enacted during the last 6 months, will provide a good basis upon which the present IRS advisor can make considerable progress.",,,,"CODY, PETER M.",,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,,2/27/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,19 May 1969,1969-05,,,,,,Training personnel|Government policy|Economic planning|Real property taxes|Income taxes|Employees|Field work|Information storage and retrieval systems|Official documents|TAX COLLECTION|Manuals and handbooks|Tax audits|Government departments|Taxation|Technical training|Indigenous education|Institution building,,Paraguay,,PD-AAC-786-F1,,,,,False,F|E,,341 KB,PDF,,526,Paraguay,,Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation,008590,USAID.

A THIRD GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN LATE 1967 AND PROVIDES TAX COMPUTATION AND NOTICE PREPARATION FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. MANUAL CARD FILES ARE BEING CONVERTED INTO A CENTRAL MASTER FILE ON MAGNETIC TAPE. INCOME TAX REVENUES IN 1967 INCREASED BY 23.8% OVER 1966; IN 1968 25.1% OVER 1967. SALES TAX REVENUES IN 1967 INCREASED BY 32.9% OVER 1966; IN 1968 14.8% OVER 1967. INCREASES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE AREAS OF AUDIT AND DELINQUENT ACCOUNT COLLECTIONS AND TO ADMINISTRATIVE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH SPEEDED UP ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION NOTICES. AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS WAS INCREASED MOST BY THE ""CROSS-CHECK"" OPERATION, A PROCEDURE FOR MATCHING INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH THIRD PARTY INFORMATION. PLANS FOR AUTOMATING THE COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS, A HIGH PRIORITY WITH THE NATIONAL TAX DIVISION, WERE DELAYED BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE DATA PROCESSING DIVISION. INSTEAD, DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS SECTIONS WERE ESTABLISHED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL USING MANUAL PROCEDURES. THE IRS FOREIGN TAX ASSISTANCE STAFF PERFORMS WELL. PARTICIPANT TRAINING FOR ADP PROGRAMMERS HAS LITTLE BENEFIT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH TURNOVER RATE IN THE NATIONAL TAX DIVISION. THE LACK OF SYSTEMS ANALYSTS AND PROGRAMERS WITHIN THE ADP DIVISION IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. IN 1967, THE DIRECTOR CONDUCTED A CAMPAIGN TO ERADICATE DISHONESTY AND IMPROPER PRACTICES AMONG PERSONNEL IN THE NATIONAL TAX DIVISION. ARRESTS WERE MADE; REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS DISMISSED, AND OTHER OFFICIALS RESIGNED. IN 7/67, A LAW FOR TAX EVASION WAS APPROVED.

THE MISSION NOTES THAT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO ASSUME THIS FUNCTION WITHIN A FEW YRS. OVERALL PROJ PERFORMANCE IS RATED SATISFACTORY. VARIOUS TYPES OF SOIL CONSERVATION PRACTICES WERE DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL AREAS OF NORTHERN NIGERIA. TRNG MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED & SOIL CONSERVATION COURSES SPONSORED FOR JUNIOR LEVEL STAFF AT TWO LOCATIONS. ALTHOUGH 58 PERSONS RECIEVED TRNG,THEY DID NOT POSSESS THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR TOP FIELD POSITIONS. THE PROJ ACTIVITIES TO DATE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFECT ON OVERALL PRODUCTION. ON THE DEMONSTRATION SITES,HOWEVER,YIELDS WERE INCREASED 10 TO 25%. PROJ EFFECTIVENESS WAS LESSENED BY THE ASSIGNMENT OF TWO TECH TEAMS TO TWO AREAS SEPARATED GEOGRAPHICALLY FROM EACH OTHER & FROM THE FIELD HDQTRS. AS A RESULT,THE TECHNICIANS WERE FORCED TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL TIME ON LOGISTICAL SUPPORT PROBLEMS. THE DEMONSTRATION EFFECT AS MEASURED BY INSTITUTION-BLDG & PRODUCTN GOALS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER WITH MORE CENTRALIZED OPERATI ONS. IN ADDITION,THE LACK OF CONTINUITY IN THE HOST-GOVT POLITICAL STRUCTURE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED INSTUTION-BLDG GOALS. U S TRNG FOR THREE PARTICIPANTS IS BEING CONSIDERED.

DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE SCHOOL IS ITS WORK-STUDY PROGRAM, A NEW CONCEPT IN LATIN AMER EDUC DESIGNED TO OVERCOME LACK OF TECH AND BUS TRNG. PERSISTANT PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE DELAY IN OBTAINING FUNDS. OVERALL PROGRAM HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL. U OF MINNESOTA CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF LOS ANDES. PROJECT DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH A CENTER IN COLOMBIA FOR GRADUATE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS WHICH COULD WITHIN A FEW YEARS BE STAFFED AND FINANCED FROM COLOMBIAN RESOURCES. DURING 1ST 2 YEARS OF PROJECT, THERE WERE FEW STUDENTS, 3 DIFF DEANS, HIGH TURNOVER OF FACULTY. IN THE LAST YEAR, UNDER A NEW DEAN, COMPETENT PART-TIME STUDENTS WERE FOUND BUT AT THE SAME TIME DISAGREEMENTS DEVELOPED BETWEEN U OF MINN AND LOCAL FACULTY OVER THE QUALITY OF RESEARCH, THE COMPETENCE OF THE STAFF AND AWARDING OF SCHOLARSHIPS. MOST NOTABLE DIFFICULTY WAS THE FAILURE OF THE HOST INSTITUTION TO PROCURE AND ADEQUATELY PAY QUALIFIED STAFF AND TO RECRUIT WELL PREPARED STUDENTS. THERE WAS NOT A SUFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL BASE OF LONG-TERM FACULTY MEMBERS AND QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITH WHICH THE CONTRACT TECHNICIANS COULD WORK TO PRODUCE SATISFYING RESULTS.

175222,"Evaluates the effectiveness of Guyana's Public Safety Program in strengthening internal security from 1966 to 1969.  Evaluation team consulted with Guyanese officials concerned with internal security and police administration, and visted rural areas. After inspecting border outposts, team finds installations effective in encouraging the development of Guyan's interior.  Progress has been made in the establishment of a joint Operations Center and an integrated command structure for coordination of the 2 internal security forces during emergency operations. A highway patrol has been created and its personnel trained. Telecommunications have been effective in training police communications personnel and expanding networks into the interior. Although US training has benefited police force capability, not enough attention has been paid to training junior grade officers.  The 100 USAID donated helmets have not been used since they do not fit over British-made gas masks.  Also, maintenance of all types of transportation vehicles is poor due to lack of parts, and maintenance techniques. Program would be improved if: l. screening of out-of-country training could be simplified; 2. Guyana's Police were given additional technical assistance, training, and commodity support; 3. a crime laboratory were established; 4. Chief Public Safety Advisor were provided assistance through the Commissioner of Police; 5. Public Safety advisor-generalist maintained US equipment; 6. junior officers received more training; 7. efforts were made to continue police department and telecommunication expansion; 8. more vehicles were secured and maintained; 9. the traffic department improved traffic flow; and 10. an effective planning unit were established within the Police Force.",Evaluation period: 18 Mar 1966-24 Oct 1969|Handwritten on cover: 504-11-710-037,,,"Trobriner, Walter N.|Ellena, Peter",,22,M,Special Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/13/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/13/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/15/1984 12:00:00 AM,1 Oct 1969,1969-10,,,10/26/1984 12:00:00 AM,,10/15/1984 12:00:00 AM,PUBLIC SAFETY|Police services|Public administration|Telecommunications technology|Police|Vocational training,,Guyana,,PD-AAP-789,,--JH,,,False,F|E,,135 KB,PDF,,504,Guyana,,Country program evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation,008553,USAID.

175309,"Evaluates performance of the Ohio State University (OSU) contract to assist in the development of the Superior School of Agriculture, Luiz de Queiroz (ESALQ) in Brazil, from 1/1/69 to 6/30/69.  ESALQ, part of the University of Sao Paulo, provides postgraduate agricultural education. Information for this report was obtained from conversations with project personnel, review of project documents, and visits to the project site. During the report period, OSU helped ESALQ achieve several things, including:  expansion of the postgraduate program, modernization of course content and instructional methods, improvement of library holdings and facilities, and establishment of a functional Agricultural Information Center. In addition, the contract team has engendered a spirit of ""wholesome internal self-advancement"" amongst the ESALQ faculty.  For example, from 1964 to 1968 a total of 66 ESALQ staff members completed requirements for various institutional degrees and defended theses for faculty advancement. Efforts to integrate graduate teaching and research have been very effective.  Several ESALQ departments assisted by the contractor are effectively carrying out training, research, and study activities of critical importance to State agricultural manpower training programs. For example, the Entomology department is assisting the Animal Nutrition Center at Nova Odessa to rear and distribute the Rhodegrass scale parasite to local farmers. National recognition was given the ESALQ/OSU project graduate program in October 1968 when it was formally accredited by the National Research Council as a ""Center of Excellence"" for the advancement of post-graduate agricultural education. The contractor's primary weakness has been failure to provide incoming technicians with an adequate level of Portuguese language training to assure early effectiveness.  Much more could also be done to stimulate within the field team an ""esprit de corps"" characterized by thorough understanding of contract goals and purposes and an appreciation of the USAID/US univerisity relationship and its role in the technical assistance program.",Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1969-30 JUN 1969,,,"KING, KERMIT C.",,31,M,Periodic Report,,,,AID/LA-161,,,,3/14/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/14/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,9 Sep 1969,1969-09,,,,,,Universities and colleges|Agricultural education|Faculty|Curriculum design|Agriculture|Information services|Reference libraries|Graduate education|Limited data,,Brazil,,PD-AAA-249-A1,,,,,False,F|E,,"1,152 KB",PDF,,512,Brazil,,Onsite evaluation,008517,USAID.

175344,"Provides 9/19/69 Special Eval of FY1962-FY1970 Agric Services Proj in Somali Republic (SR) and of Univ of Wyoming (UWY) contractor performance since 1965.  Proj designed to assist Ministry of Agric (MOA) develop effective research program & extension service to facilitate Somali agric dvlp. Eval by AID agric officer at request of USAID/SR & AID/W consists of document review, onsite observation, & discussions with principals & GSR officials. Evaluator notes evident, though slow, progress, more significant in research than in extension area.  UWY staff judged well-qualified and capable in proj leadership; most serious shortfall was in lag in appointing chief extension advisor.  Afgoi research station has provided useful data vital to crop dvlp of rice & edible safflower oil (major Somali import items), sorghum, peanuts, & of grapfruit (along with bananas the major foreign exchange earners).  A soils lab is reasonably operative. Bonka Farmers Trng Center has provided modest, though important trng of 30 agric extension instructors (15 of these now assigned to villages) and 1000-1100 farmers, but has been plagued by lapses in GSR scheduled funding. 23 Somalis have been or are engaged in US partic trng:  14 short-term; 7 BS, & 2 MS. Proj hampered by extended delay in construction of National Agric Center (expected completion date is now mid-1970), & by lack of full GSR counterpart staffing & funding support.  Key counterpart slots remain unfilled, or slated counterparts are still in US participant trng.  GSR funding, erratic & incomplete in past, has been recommitted in 1969 ProAg.

The author visited Mazatenango after the last regional seminar and noted that municipal officials were much more satisfied.  In the next session, the group will be split into two groups of secretaries and treasurers.  This will permit INAD (National Institute for Municipal Administration) to work with smaller groups on a more intensive level and provide information which specifically applies to each group.

175496,"INTERIM ASSESSMENT AS OF 9/12/69 OF THE OPERATIONS OF GERAN, THE SPECIAL GROUP FOR THE RATIONALIZATION OF THE NORTHEAST SUGAR AGRO-INDUSTRY, BY USAID/NE BRAZIL. GERAN WAS CREATED IN AUG 1966 TO MODERNIZE THE FLAGGING NE SUGAR ECONOMY, TO DIVERSIFY THE AGRIC OF THE SUGAR ZONE, AND TO MODIFY THE AGRARIAN STRUCTURE THROUGH LAND REFORM. USAID HAS THUS FAR PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF A 3-MAN DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND A VOCATIONAL AGRIC TRAINING ADVISOR. USAID OFFICIALS TRACE HISTORY OF GERAN FROM ITS INCEPTION,NOTING ITS FORMATIVE PERIOD AND ITS INITIAL STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES PRIOR TO A DEC 1968 DECREE REORGANIZING GERAN AND PROVIDING FOR ITS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY TO ASSUME A STRONGER ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE. ITS FINANCIAL UNDERGIRDING HAS THUS FAR PROVEN TENUOUS AS EXPECTED REVENUES FROM A SHARE IN THE SUGAR MARKETING TAX HAVE NOT BEEN REALIZED. GERAN'S OPERATIONAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN REDESIGNED; INSTEAD OF MOUNTING A MAJOR PROGRAMMING EFFORT,IT EXPECTS TO ENTERTAIN PROJ APPLICATIONS,OFFERING FUNDING AND TECH ASSISTANCE IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. USAID OBSERVERS CONSIDER THE PROSPECTS GOOD FOR GERAN ACHIEVING ITS OBJECTIVES,THOUGH MAJOR SUCCESS WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON ADEQUATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

176199,"EVALAUTES PROJECT TO IMPROVE PRIMARY EDUCATION IN HONDURAS AS OF 10/31/68. THIS SUBPROJ INVLOVED TEACHER TRAINING AND THE PROVISION OF TEXTBOOKS. FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED TRAINING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO AND HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO POSITIONS IN THREE EXPERIMENTAL NORMAL SCHOOLS IN HONDURAS. THREE OF THE RETURNED PARTICIPANTS ASSISTED IN A READING WORKSHOP FOR FIRST AND SECOND GRADE TEACHERS AT THE UYUMBICHO NORMAL SCHOOL. SURPRISINGLY, THE PARTICIPANTS SENT TO THE THREE NORMAL SCHOOLS WERE NOT WELL RECIEVED. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE CHOSEN THROUGH A NATIONAL COMPETITION, ON THE PREMISE OF ENSURING THE SELECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ABLE TEACHERS. IT IS NOW BELIEVED THAT THE PARTICIPANTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED FROM THE THREE NORMAL SCHOOLS TO FACILITATE THEIR ACCEPTANCE. A LONGER FULL-TIME PERIOD FOR STUDENT TEACHING HAS BEEN INSTITUTED AT THE NORMAL SCHOOLS. A TEAM OF SIX WRITERS WAS ASSIGNED TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MEC) TEXTBOOK PROGRAM. THE WRITERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF TEXTBOOKS IN THREE PRIMARY EDUCATION FIELDS. THE AUTHORS NOTE THAT AVAILABILITY OF EXCELLENT TEXTBOOK MATERIALS,SOME IN SPANISH,PRECLUDES THIER PRODUCTION FROM SCRATCH. THUS PROJECTS OF THIS TYPE SHOULD FOCUS ON ADAPTING,TRANSLATING,AND ILLUSTRATING EXISTING MATERIALS. THE MOE SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THE SELECTION OF AN ESTABLISHMENT FOR PRINTING TEXTBOOKS,DEVISING A WORKABLE PLAN FOR STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF TEXTBOOKS,AND ESTABLISHING A FUND FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF TEXTBOOKS. A MAJOR PROBLEM DURING THE PROJECT PERIOD HAS BEEN FREQUENT TURNOVER,NOT ONLY OF TOP-LEVEL MINISTRY POSITIONS,BUT ALSO OF PERSONNEL WITHIN THE NORMAL SCHOOLS.

THE FACULTY NOW HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 16000 STUDENTS AND HAS A REALISTIC APPROACH ON HOW TO EXPAND THE CIRRICULUM. EIGHT PARTICIPANTS ARE RECEIVING PHD  IN THE US AND 5 OTHERS HAVE BEEN TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR PLACEMENT IN 1970. A US LIBRARIAN HAS PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FACULTY LIBRARY,INCLUDING ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT OF BASIC ECONOMIC REFERENCE BOOKS. ALTHOUGH PAST SEMINARS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL,ADJUSTMENTS ARE BEING MADE FOR FUTURE SEMINARS SO THEY WILL BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE BY CONCENTRATING ON FEWER TOPICS IN MORE DEPTH AND INCLUDING UNDERGRADUATE SENIORS. THE PRESENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHIEF OF PARTY HAVE LIMITED HIS ABILITY TO PERFORM ALL HIS ASSIGNED TASKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COORDINATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN UM STAFF AND THE CHIEF OF PARTY.

UPON COMPLETION OF A SURVEY OF BOLIVIA'S NEEDS IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMIC PLANNING,USAID SIGNED A CONTRACT (6/66) FOR ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING. TWO ADVISORS,IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS AND PROJECT EVALUATION CAME ON BOARD IN THE LATTER PART OF CY66. A THIRD ADVISOR IN INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS WAS ASSIGNED IN CY'67. HOWEVER, THE TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIST WERE TERMINATED EARLY BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE COUNTERPART PARTICIPATING AND LITTLE EVIDENCE OF POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT. THE PROJECT EVALUATION (AND CAPITAL BUDGETING) ADVISOR REMAINED AND WILL COMPLETE HIS TOUR IN 3/70. CURRENTLY,ASSISTANCE IS BEING DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVEMENT OF THE INITIAL CAPITAL BUDGET PRESENTATION FOR CY'70. SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES FOR PROJECT PREPARATION,THE ORGANIZATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A NATIONAL PROJECT INVENTORY AND ON-JOB TRAINING OF BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS IN THESE AREAS. THIS PHASE IS PROGRESSING REASONABLE WELL,DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY OF REGULAR COUNTERPART PARTICIPATION. THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (IDB) IS FAVORABLY CONSIDERING PROVISION OF A FOUR TO FIVE-MAN ADVISORY TEAM TO THE PLANNING AGENCY.

175700,"Reports on USAID assistance from 6/1/69-6/30/69 to improve public administration at the national level in Guatemala. The proposed salary scale for the Civil Service is ready for submission to Congress.  However, it would cost $600,000 at a minimum and passage at this time is unlikely.  All 560 class specifications for 5 career categories were completed.  The Basic Civil Service Regulations were also completed and reviewed by the Civil Service Commission.  The Guatemalan System covers approx 44,000 employees including teachers. During the month a major crisis was resolved.  A proposal for a congressional amendment allowing a one yr breather in implementing the new Civil Service System gained wide support.  The proposal resulted from concern over ""losing"" control of the appointment process at the highest office level.  The author notes that it was feared that the best informed personnel were being groomed in the INAD (Natl Institute for Development Administration), with opposition party inclinations. However, after a series of ministerial & congressional meetings, it was decided to proceed with the program. The Governor, Mayor, numerous central govt officials and about 200 participants & guests attended the inaugural session of a regional course in municipal development. A total of 90 officials enrolled in the three US Municipal Secretary courses. The second regional course in Mazantenago is underway with about 60 participants.  Work is continuing with a Congressional Committee to develop a model law for the protection of minors and the operation of juvenile courts. Documentation was completed for AID commodities for the planned National Campesino Training School.  The Income Tax Office Management Study and Supervisors Development are awaiting AID/W clearance.

175701,"Reports on USAID assistance from 6/1/69-6/30/69 to improve municipal administration in Guatemala. Much of the month was spent preparing a loan for INFOM (National Municipal Promotion Institute). Regional seminars for municipal officials began 6/14/69 in Chimaltenango with 96 officials registered. About 40 officials registered at the Center at Mazatenago and another 40 at Huehuetenago.  The officials are eager to learn. They are from municipalities of various sizes and have varied educational backgrounds. INAD (National Institute for Development Administration) did a commendable job of organizing the seminars.  AMAN (National Association of Municipalities) is the weakest organization in the municipal movement. Although it is a co-sponsor of the regional seminars, its role has been minimal. The Peace Corps volunteers in Santa Lucia, Cotz and Tiquisate have done an excellent job.  However, the Peace Corps overall has not shown great interest in the municipal development program.  Although the future of the Peace Corps program is questionable, the author recommends that the volunteers who have continued to do an effective job be given full support. The author also notes that the future role of AID in local government activities is unclear -- and that this has presented problems in completing current activities.

175707,"Reports on USAID assistance from 6/1/69-6/30/69 to improve tax administration in Guatemala.  The GOG Directorate General of Income Taxes has begun an audit of 1500 taxpayers for the filing period ending 9/68.  The returns will follow a ratio of economic activity to the total number of returns filed -- 15% agriculture, 25% industry, 45% commerce and 15% personal services.  The Director of Income Taxes is establishing a personnel system which rotates personnel between the review staff & the audit group hoping to reduce the high number of inadequate or incomplete examinations returned to the Audit Division from the review staff.  Eighty-two property appraisals were completed during May. Collections statistics for ordinary & consigned revenues for May are attached.  Collections in 1969 continued to reflect an increase over the same period for 1968.  However, collections compared to budget showed a Q3.6 mil deficit. Two short training sessions were held for audit personnel on the Intnatl Sales Method of accounting. Participants in a fundamental accounting home-study course numbered 95 including 25 inspectors from the interior of the country.  The course began in June.  A course on the net worth method of determing omitted income will be given soon.  The author notes that uncertainties relating to the recent change over of the Minister of Finance caused a substantial drop in morale & work performance.",Evaluation period: 1 JUN 1969-30 JUN 1969,,,"RAMOS, JOHN C.",,31,M,Periodic Report,,,,,,,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,2 Jul 1969,1969-07,,,,,,TAXATION|Training personnel|Government policy|Economic planning|Vehicles|Taxes|Statistical data|Information storage and retrieval systems|Tax collection|Manuals and handbooks|Tax assessments|Tax audits|Technical training|Limited data,,Guatemala,,PD-AAA-916-B1,,,,,True,F|E,,634 KB,PDF,,520,Guatemala,,Onsite evaluation,008550,USAID.

171779,"GRANT TO THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY (EAC) TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL TRAINING FOR MID & UPPER LEVEL EAC PERSONNEL. THE EAC, ORGANIZED IN 1967, IS THE SUCCESSOR TO THE EAST AFRICAN COMMON SERVICES ORGANIZATION (EACSO) AND HAS DERIVATIVE, THOUGH EXPANDED, RESPONSIBILITIES-NAMELY, TO OPERATE A NUMBER OF LONG STANDING INTERCOUNTRY SERVICES AND TO RECONSTITUTE THE EAST AFRICAN COMMON MARKET. PROJECT RESPONDS TO ANEED FOR ALLEVIATING THE SHORTAGE OF WELL TRAINED PERSONNEL ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EAC ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE FUNDING OF TRAINING IN THE US. IN ITS EARLIER STAGES, THE PROJ ASSISTED EACSO IN THE REPLACEMENT OF SENIOR EXPATRIATES BY AN INDIGENOUS STAFF. DURING THIS PHASE, THE PROJECT SUPPORTED LONGER TERM ACADEMIC TRAINING TO EACSO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND AN IN-SERVICE TRAINING ADVISOR TO EACSO'S GENERAL FUND SERVICES, AND DONATED SMALL AMOUNTS OF BOOKS AND AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENT. THE ADVISOR WAS REMOVED AFTER ONE YEAR BECAUSE OF A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN AID & EACSO AS TO THE INTENDED ROLE OF THE ADVISOR IN THE PROJECT. SINCE FY1966 MORE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD SHORT-TERM OBSERVATION AND ON-THE-JOB TRAINING IN US INSTITUTIONS. THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN BROADENED TO INCLUDE HIGHER LEVEL TECHNICAL AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT TRAINING. THE SHIFT TO SHORT TERM TRAINING IS A RESULT OF THE NEED FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF TRAINED INDIVIDUALS PROVIDED IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME. THE EAC, AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, HAS INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES; THE SHIFT IN THE PROJECT CORRESPONDS TO THE FORMATION OF THE EAC FROM THE EACSO. PROJECT DESIGN SINCE INCEPTION CALLS FOR FINANCING TRAINING FOR AS MANY PARTICIPANTS AS POSSIBLE GIVEN FIXED ANNUAL BUDGETING. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS TRAINED PER YEAR AVERAGES 8-12 (THE TOTAL NUMBER TRAINED BY TERMINATION OF PROJECTBEING 84). THE SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS  IS BASED UPON A CANDIDATE'S APTITUDE, PROMOTION PROSPECTS, PREVIOUS EDUCATION AND BACKGROUND, AND WHETHER HIS TRAINING COULD SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT THE EAC OR HAVE AN IMPACT UPON OTHER AID PROJECTS. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS WHETHER THE US OFFERS PARTICULARLY GOOD TRAINING IN HIS FIELD OR WHETHER A PRACTICAL AND REALISTIC PROGRAM COULD BE ARRANGED.",,,,"EATON, G.

171507,"Grant provided to the Mekong Coordinating Committee to support its data collection and planning activities directed toward the development of the water and related land resources of the Lower Mekong Basin. THE ""Committee for the Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin"" is composed of representatives from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It sponsors activities such as basic data collection, basinwide planning, mainstream and tributary project planning, navigation improvement, flood control, agricultural development, and ancillary projects including experimental and demonstration farms, mineral surveys, power market projections, technical and economic training, social development, and public health. Under this project, a detailed status report on the ""amplified basin plan"" will be completed. The report will update previous investigations and set priorities for Mekong development investments. it will also list further pre-investment investigations for possible us or other donor financing. Examples of activities which the US may be called upon to support include: 1) collection and analysis of hydraulic data, 2) water quality investigations (effect of irrigation return flows), 3) revision of Mekong Basin resources atlas, 4) establishment of a regional operating organization, 5) analysis of resettlement problems and other social aspects of mekong development, 6) alternative approaches to delta development (storage vs levee methods of water control), 7) investigations into the productivity and management of tropical soils, 8) ecological impact studies on plant, fish, and animal life, 9) feasibility study of the Nam Pong PILOT irrigation project, 10) implementation of the pilot Nam Ngum fishery development project, 11) studies of aquatic plant management, and 12) waterborne diseases (schistosomiasis).

156599,"An analysis of the productivities of various forms of capital resources at the farm level. Basic data collected concerning the 1965 farm operations of 821 farmers in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, Brazil, were analyzed to determine:  (1) how captial resources were being used on the farms:  (2) the productivities attributible to the use of those capital resources:  (3) variations in resource allocation and productivities among farms with different characteristics:  and (4) specific policy implications:  of the findings. Among the authors findings and conclusions: The results of the analysis demonstrate rather conclusively that agricultural activity is so diversely organized that broad generalizations are not very useful as policy guides. Possibilities looked partly because of lack of understanding of the potentials existing in various types of farm operations. The following findings are discussed in detail:  Farm operations. The following findings are discussed in detail:  Farm operations with 20 to 30 hectares of productive land, using draft animal power, make relatively full use of available land, labor, and capital resources.  Farms with less than 20 hectares of productive land do not adequately use the available family labor resource unless the farm is engaged in a specialized labor-intensive enterprise.  Farms with more than 30 hectares either have a lower percentage of total area cultivated or have additional capital investments for power sources. With all types of farms, the larger the farm size, the more the average returns diminish in terms of yield per hectare. Crop farms and especially mechanized crop farms are making greater use of profitable new crop inputs and credit than are livestock farms. Farms with less than ten hectares of produtive land are notgenerating sufficient income to meet annual production, consumption, and investment needs.  The change from traditional livestock farming to mechanized crop farms has resulted in a sixfold increase in gross output. Unlike what might be expected, the quantity of labor used on mechanized crop farms, in comparison with livestock farms, is 50 per cent greater. The level of credit use on mechanized crop farms is ten times greater on traditional livestock farms. Crop expenses per hectare are 2.5  to 8 times greater on mechanized crop farms than on non-mechanized small farms. Amounts of credit used for purchasing these inputs are 8 to 20 times greater on mechanized crop farms. Management performance is a strong indicator of level of productivity. Managers rate higher on livestock practices than on crop practices.","Research summary, 1968/1969",,4:2,,,54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,AID/csd-1937,,,,12/2/1982 12:00:00 AM,,3/8/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1969,1969,,,,,,Capital|Farm management|Financing,,Brazil,,PN-AAB-867,,,,,True,F|E,,"6,049 KB",PDF,,512,Brazil,,,000905,Ohio State University.

156609,"A summary of the effects of synthetic sucroglycerides on quality of soy enriched breads.  The improving effects of synthetic glycolipids are compared wth the effects of commercial shortening and of polar wheat flour lipids rich and galactolipids.  The conclusion presented in Part I of this paper are that sucroesters seem to improve bread quality by rendering the soy proteins functional in breadmaking.  Sucroesters counteracted the loaf volume-depressing effects of the soy products. Mixing synthetic glycolipids with soy flours or adding glycolipids at the doughmixing stage therefore appears useful in producing nutritionally improved bread acceptable to consumers.  The sucroesters appear useful in manufacturing bread low in the saturated fatty acids in shortening, or of protein-rich dietetic breads, which have been recommended as effective supplements to diets to treat obesity.  The effects seem to indicate that the synthetic glycolipids make the noncereal proteins functional in breadmaking.

156686,"India is entering the phase in which marketing and distribution are critical elements in feeding the hungry. An example of this marketing problem came with the introduction of hybrid maize into Tamil Nadu. Maize production could not realize its full poten- tial, because market outlets were not established clearly.  Too, the farmer must have a relatively high degree of assurance that there will be a satisfactory market for his crop before he plants it.  With these general problems in mind, the objectives of this study were as follows:  1) to describe the present market oganization and infrastructure for the food grains; 2) to deter- mine the capacity of the present system to handle the projected increases in food grain production; 3) to outline significant marketing and government officials. It was found that politics must be put aside when making important marketing decisions, dog- ma and form must be ignored in setting up new market institu- tions, and concentration must be on the changes required to mod- ernize the present market structure and to build the capability in the responsible organization for making the changes deemed desirable.",,,4:2,"Badenhop, M.

175238,"Evaluates, as of 6/15/69, the Private Development and Productivity Center element of the Private Enterprise Development project (1966-1972) in Paraguay. The Center, founded in 10/66, is designed to promote private enterprise and train entrepreneurial talent. Overall achievement of project targets to date is judged satisfactory, especially in areas of investment promotion and training courses. A series of management training courses were well accepted and supported locally. Subject matter included marketing, general business management, financial management, cost accounting, production administration, etc. Consulting services to the business community, previously lacking at the Center, have been substantially increased now that a full complement of contract US advisors have been recruited. Among investment promotions under consideration are a barge project for about $15 million and an allied limestone exploitation project estimated to produce $7 million annually in foreign exchange. The participant training program has been one of the most successful aspects of the entire project. USAID has provided short-term training to more than 30 participants from both the public and private sectors, and to members of the Center's Directive Council and staff. Lack of room for expansion and limited financial support by the business community have hampered Center operations. Contributions from the Center's sponsors - the Federation of Producers, Industry, and Commerce (FEPRINCO), and the Paraguayan Industrial Union - have covered only 11% of the Center's budget and payment has been slow. If salaries for Paraguayan counterparts are not increased, it is feared that personnel trained by the Center will leave for higher paying jobs elsewhere. The financial situation is, however, improving thanks to revenues from training courses and increased consulting services.

THE YOUNGER (UNDER 40) MEMBERS OF THE MIDDLE ELITE IN GUATEMALA ARE POLITICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND AWARE BUT ARE NOT REVOLUTION-MINDED. THEY ADVOCATE PEACEFUL CHANGES IN THE LAW AND IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. THEY EMPHASIZE EDUCATION AS THE BEST VEHICLE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND CHANGE. THE MIDDLE ELITE ARE POTENTIALLY ASSIMILABLE INTO THE TOP ELITE IF THE LATTER WILL PERMIT IT. THE PROBLEMS THEY CITE MOST FREQUENTLY ARE UNEMPLOYMENT, ILLITERACY, THE POLITICAL DOMINATION BY THE MILITARY, HIGH DEATH RATE AND TAX RATE, UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, THE HIGH COST OF LIVING, AND ""VIOLENCE"" IN THE COUNTRY. AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS AT LOYOLA, LANDIVAR, AND IDF SHOWED THAT THEY HAVE MADE NO IMPRESSIVE CHANGES IN ATTITUDES OR BEHAVIOR. THE ""BENEFITS"" ARE VIRTUALLY UNSPECIFIABLE, PARTLY BECAUSE SOME ARE INTANGIBLE AND CAN NOT BE MEASURED WELL WITH THE INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED.

173771,"EVALUATES PROJECT PERFORMANCE AS OF 6/30/69 IN COLOMBIA. PROJECT INTENDED TO ESTABLISH AND DEVELOP THE INITIAL OPERATIONS OF A PLANNING OFFICE (MOP) WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE. AN INITIAL DELAY WAS EXPERIENCED BECAUSE THE PLANNING OFFICE HAD NOT BEEN ORGANIZED, COUNTERPARTS NOT SELECTED, AND THE DESIRED STUDY AREAS NOT IDENTIFIED BY THE GOC AS HAD BEEN PLANNED. THE REASON FOR THIS WAS THAT THE MIN OF AGR WAS UNDERTAKING A MAJOR REORGANIZATION OF THE AGR SECTOR; ALSO BECAUSE NEW STAFFING LEVELS FOR GOVT MINISTRIES HAD NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BY PRESIDENT LLERAS. UNITL THAT TIME WHEN THE COUNTERPARTS ACTUALLY WERE ON BOARD (JUNE 1969), THE US DEPT OF AGR (USDA) PASA TEAM WAS LIMITED TO THE GATHERING OF DATA AND THE PROVISION OF OCCASIONAL ADVISORY ASSISTANCE TO VARIOUS SEMI-AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES. TWO STUDIES WERE COMPLETED DURING THIS PERIOD: 1)A STUDY OF EXPORT PRICES FOR INDEMA, THF GOC AGR MARKETING AGENCY; AND 2)A STUDY OF TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION AND POLICY FOR INTRA, THE NATL TRANSPORT AGENCY. THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE RESULTING PAPERS DEMONSTRATED THEIR PROFESSIONALISM TO THE GOC AND OVERCAME THE SUSPICIONS HELD BY MINISTRY OFFICIALS OF THE TEAM'S RELATIONSHIP TO USAID AND US NATIONAL POLICY OBJECTIVES. AT THE TIME OF THIS EVALUATION TEAM MEMBERS WERE PREPARING A STUDY FOR DETERMINING SECTOR FERTILIZER COSTS & REQUIREMENTS; COLLECTING DATA ON SELECTED CROPS TO ASCERTAIN THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF PRICE SUPPORTS; COLLECTING DATA ON CATTLE PRODUCTION & COSTS; AND DESIGNING INTEGRATED TRANSPORT OPERATIONS FOR AGR SECTOR AGENCIES WHICH USE COMMON TRANSPORT ROUTES AND SCHEDULES. ONE LESSON LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROJECT IS THAT AID SHOULD EXPECT SOME DELAYS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS WHICH SEEK TO DEVELOP PLANNING CAPABILITIES. THIS IS DUE TO THE TIME REQUIRED BY ADVISORS IN BUILDING CONFIDENCE WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE SLOW PROCESS OF INCORPORATING A PLANNING ORGANIZATION INTO EXISTING GOVERNMENT STURCTURES. THE MIN OF AGR REORGANIZATION EFFORT WHICH DELAYED THIS PROJECT WILL PROBABLY HAVE THE BENEFICIAL END RESULT OF STREAMLINING ITS OPERATIONS AND FACILITATING COORDINATION OF AGR PROGRAMS & INVESTMENTS.",Evaluation period: Through 30 Jun 1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,LA(AJ)43-67,,,,3/15/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/15/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,11 Jul 1969,1969-07,,,,,,Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Institution building|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning,,Colombia,,PD-AAA-376-E1,,,,,False,,,,,,514,Colombia,,Limited data,008530,USAID.

314061,"The history and status of United States technical and capital assistance (a billion dollars since 1942) for water supply in developing countries are reviewed by region and country, including its context as part of foreign aid generally and its growth from early days (1942) in Latin America to a global program and an important element of multilateral programs.  The essential role of water supply in developing countries is reviewed with particular attention to health, economic development, nutrition, population control, and political and social development.  Current deficiencies and needs are outlined by region. Six projects from the hundreds undertaken are highlighted as examples of educational assistance (Regional School of Sanitary Engineering for Central America), development and strengthening of a national water supply program (Brazil), institution-building (Department of Public Health Engineering in East Pakistan), technological development (new handpump for wells), capital assistance (John F. Kennedy Memorial Water System in Yemen), and rural water supply (Thailand).  Lessons and observations based on a quarter-century of experience include: (1) community water supplies in developing countries are still generally inadequate despite recent progress; (2) community water supplies are essential investments for community development and sustained economic growth, they encourage progressive forces, emphasize human progress, and stimulate self-help concepts; (3) a self-liquidating water supply system is a feasible goal for urban communities of even the poorest countries; (4) well-conceived, well engineered water supply projects can attract international financing; (5) preventive health programs that ignore water supply are invariably failures; (6) deficiencies in personnel and in institutions are currently the critical factors in development of community water supplies, not technology and probably not capital -- a realistic program for improvement will require attention to institution building and personnel training; and (7) the major accomplishment of the Community Water Supply Program is not hardware but the progress to date in establishment or strengthening of water supply institutions; however technical assistance must be continued until these have ripened to full maturity.

THE INCEPTION AND TESTING OF THAT DESIGN IS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT, FOLLOWED BY A BROAD SURVEY OF METHODS OF SURVEY RESEARCH AND THEIR APPLICABILITY TO THE CONDUCT OF SAMPLE SURVEYS IN THE URBAN AREAS OF DEVELOPING NATIONS. ALSO DESCRIBED ARE: METHODOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES FOR MEASURING HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITY; SOCIOECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF FAMILIES; ATTITUDES, ASPIRATIONS, AND VALUE ORIENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING; AND, TWO MEANS BY WHICH A HOUSING SITUATION IS IMPROVED: RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF OWNER-OCCUPIED HOUSING.

THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES OUR STUDIES WITH INFANTS AND CHILDREN IN THE ENRICHMENT WITH METHIONINE OR LYSINE OF A VARIETY AND NUMBER OF PROTEIN SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SOY AND WHEAT. THE ADDITION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF DL-METHIONINE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCES THE BIOLOGICAL VALUE OF SOY PROTEINS. THE STRIKING LYSINE DEFICIENCY OF WHEAT FLOUR, WHICH LIMITS THE USE OF THIS VERSATILE AND ACCEPTABLE CEREAL, CAN ALSO BE CORRECTED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THE ADDITION OF FPC AT THE 10 PERCENT LEVEL CORRECTS THE LYSINE DEFICIENCY AND DOUBLES THE PROTEIN CONTENT.

173639,"AS OF 12-31-68. PAR DEALS EXCLUSIVELY WITH CUSTOMS ACTIVITIES. ONE FULL-TIME ADVISOR AND TEMPORARY DUTY TECHNICIANS FROM THE US BUREAU OF CUSTOMS CONDUCTED STUDIES TO IDENTIFY KEY PROBLEMS AND RECOMMEND SOLUTIONS. SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS WERE MADE IN THREE AREAS: 1)A VIABLE CENTRAL ENTRY OFFICE WAS CREATED IN PANAMA CITY IN 4/68. FOUR SEPARATE CUSTOM HOUSES WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE CONVENIENT OFFICE WHERE IMPORTERS CAN BRING ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO EFFECT CUSTOMS CLEARANCE OF THEIR SHIPMENTS (EITHER SEA, AIR, LAND, OR MAIL). 2)IN 12/68, A REORGANIZATION OF CUSTOMS ACTIVITIES WAS APPROVED. DIFFUSE RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE CONSOLIDATED UNDER A SINGLE AGENCY: THE CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT (A STAFF OFFICE OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF REVENUES). THE DEPARTMENT OF FISCAL VIGILANCE, WHICH HAD ABSORBED MANY RESPONSIBILITIES NORMALLY ASSUMED BY THE CUSTOMS ORGANIZATION, HAS BEEN CLEARLY RESTRICTED TO ITS ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIVE AND INTELLIGENCE ROLE. IF SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE NEW CUSTOMS ORGANIZATION, ""PERHAPS NOVEL IN THIS HEMISPHERE,"" WILL PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. 3)A PROJECT WAS BEGUN TO EMPLOY AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING TO CONTROL THE INVENTORIES OF PRIVATE FIRMS IN THE COLON FREE ZONE. CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT RESISTANCE TO ADP HAS INHIBITED PROGRESS. ACHIEVEMENTS OF SECONDARY SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDE: 1)A SYSTEM FOR SETTING IMPORT QUOTAS WAS ESTABLISHED. 2)AN AUDIT SELECTION WAS ORGANIZED AND 18 FISCAL INVESGATORS WERE TRAINED TO IMPROVE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND ANTI-SMUGGLING ACTIVITIES. (HOWEVER, MOST INVESTIGATORS WERE NOT UTILIZED AS SUCH BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISCAL VIGILANCE HAD NO CAPACITY OR WILLINGNESS TO ABSORB THEM IN THAT CAPACITY.) 3)ADDITIONAL WAREHOUSE SPACE AND PLANS FOR A NEW CUSTOMS HOUSE WERE DEVELOPED. 4)A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR REPORTING VOLUME AND VALUE OF CUSTOMS TRANSACTIONS WAS ADOPTED.

175564,"Evaluates USAID assistance to Afghanistan, as of 10/15/68 in rehabilitating & extending the electrical power systems in the Helmand-Arghandab Valley.  The project began in FY '57 with a loan of $430,000 & a grant of $120,000 to improve and extend the electrical distribution system in Kandahar and install two 500kw diesel generators. Supporting assistance funds ($2,801,300) were also provided to construct a hydro-electric plant at Arghadab.  Later the location was changed to Kajakai & the dam's size increased from 6,400kw to 33,000kw.  Other major activities included repairs & modifications to the 1,000kw Kandahar diesel plant and the Girishy hydro-electric plant. Hydraulic model studies of the Girishy plant were conducted at Kabul University and the US contractor, Harza Engineering Co, supervised the repairs. The plant was successfully tested and accepted by USAID in 9/65. Construction supervision and training for the rehabilitation and extension of the Kandahar and Girishy/Lashkar GAH Distribution System began 4/68 with the arrival of NRECA (Natl Electric Cooperative Association) linemen and is progressing satisfactorily. However, the procurement of commodities was not satisfactory.  Harza (responsible for design, procurement & engineering supervision) delayed in placing orders and did not expedite shipments.  Consequently, this project element is one yr behind schedule. Twenty-seven participants were trained in the US or Iran. Another three are scheduled for out-of-country trng in utility mgmt and operation & maintenance. An important project lesson was that responsibility for contract administration should be centralized. Difficulties occurred early in the proj because responsibility for administration of the Harza contract was vested with Helmand-Arghandab Valley Region (HAVR) rather than with the engineering division in Kabul.  The mission also notes that 10% of the ordered insulators arrived broken due to improper packaging in US manufacturing plants.  AID/W was informed and a complete report with photographs will be forwarded.  The project is scheduled to end in 1970.",Evaluation period: Through 15 Oct 1968,,,"MCCLURE, RUSSELL S.",,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,7/19/1983 12:00:00 AM,6 Feb 1969,1969-02,,,7/28/1983 12:00:00 AM,,7/19/1983 12:00:00 AM,Diesel engines|Electric power plants|Hydroelectric power|Electrical system maintenance|Vocational training|Electric utilities|Management training|ELECTRIFICATION|Electric power generation|Dry season|Electric power distribution,,Afghanistan,,PD-AAM-499,,,,,False,F|E,,"2,169 KB",PDF,,306,Afghanistan,,Limited data,008504,USAID.

175565,"Evaluates progress as of 2/15/69 of PASA with US Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec) for assistance begun in FY1960 to the Helmand-Arghandab Valley Regional Authority (HAVA) in Afghanistan. BuRec was to assist HAVA in the planning, construction, mgmt, operations & maintenance of an irrigation & drainage proj; in the training of HAVA personnel; and in improvement of HAVA procurement & warehousing procedures. Proj administered through Water Resources Advisor Group (WRAG) whose efforts have contributed to generally successful program.  Trng provided to 31 participants & a feasibility study made for 31,000 acre development program in the Shamalan area. Significant progress made in improving warehouse procedures.  Because HAVA has been unable to supply adequate on-the-job trainees, only 80 out of projected 180 Afghans trained in design, construction, operations & maintenance, supply. Likewise 9 of projected 21 professionals & 29 of 34 sub-professionals trained in proj dvlp planning. HAVA has done little to rehabilitate existing irrigation system since completion of main storage, distribution & drainage system. Unrestricted water use has led to solarization of part of irrigated area.  Procedures must be instituted to prevent overuse of water leading to soil deterioration.  Long-term provisions still not made for continuation of effective procurement system upon activity termination. Other problems include lack of data for proper study of land dvlp, absence of adequate water laws, taxes & assessments.  Personnel, logistics, & supply problems persist as well as deficiency of HAVA physical resource inputs.  Implementation of plans hampered by lack of personnel competent to accept responsibility & lack of follow-through on decisions. Eval recommends that HAVA develop systematic procurement schedules and that it make concerted effort to fill staff vacancies with qualified personnel.  Greater effort urged in execution of Shamalan proj, including intense public relations campaign.

MISSION BELIEVED,HOWEVER,THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF TRAINED AFGHANS ALREADY ON THE FACULTY,FACULTY COULD MOVE AHEAD WITH NEW PLANS. MORE EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON SUBJECT-MATTER TRAINING & LESS ON PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. CUTBACKS IN AID REDUCED NUMBER OF ADVISORS IN FACULTY TO THREE. STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS REDUCED ATTENDANCE IN CLASSES & REQUIRED 2-MONTH EXTENSION OF SECOND SEMESTER. IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAM, SPECIALISTS DISAGREED ON HOW ENGLISH AS FOREIGN LANGUAGE SHOULD BE TAUGHT. RECOMMENDED THAT ONCE BASIC PLAN IS ESTABLISHED, PROJECT POLICY SHOULD REQUIRE SUBSEQUENT SPECIALISTS TO CONTINUE WITH THAT PLAN. TCCU FAILED TO RECRUIT & MAINTAIN COMPLETE FIELD TEAM. PROBLEMS ALSO OCCURRED IN PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROGRAM WITH SOME POOR SELECTIONS & INADEQUATE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ABILITY. ALSO REPORTED POOR ORIENTATION OF RETURNEES; FAILURE TO KEEP AGREEMENTS FOR UTILIZATION OF RETURNEES; AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN PERSONNEL & POSITIONS.

THE PILOT PROJECT, LOCATED NEAR YABELO, FOCUSES ON INCREASING LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION THROUGH PROVEN RANGE AND STOCK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON DATA FROM THE REGIONAL LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WHICH PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR ESTIMATES CONCERNING COST/BENEFITS, PERSONNEL AND WATER/CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR EXPANDING THE LIVESTOCK PROJECTS TO 3 MORE UNITS LOCATED IN ARRERO, NEGHELE AND DARMETU. DATA REVEALED THAT THE PROJECT YIELDED A HIGH RATE OF INTERNAL RETURN ON CAPITAL; REQUIRED MINIMUM TECHNICAL PERSONNEL; INVOLVED SIMPLE ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE PEOPLE; AND INCREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNINGS. EACH RANGE MGMT UNIT WILL BE ORGANIZED UNDER A PROJECT MANAGER. EACH RANGE WILL TRY TO BECOME ECONOMICALLY SELF-LIQUIDATING. THE 5-YEAR PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WILL GRADUALLY PROVIDE EACH UNIT WITH WATER FACILITIES, ROADS, CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVED MANAGERIAL PRACTICES AND EXPANDED OPERATIONS. ETHIOPIAN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERS WILL HANDLE 1) OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND SUPERVISION; 2) SURVEYING, CONSTRUCTING OF BUILDINGS, WELLS, STORAGE TANKS PIPELINES AND DRINKING TROUGHS. ANIMAL HEALTH, BREEDING AND MARKETING WILL BE SUPERVISED BY A LIVESTOCK AND MEAT BOARD. GREATEST ANTICIPATED BENEFIT IS INCREASED TAKE-OFF OF SALEABLE BEEF ANIMALS.

175571,"Evaluates the agricultural production subproject for the State of Tamil Nadu, India, as of 12/31/68.  Each of the 5 subject matter specialists from the University of Tennessee have been assigned 2 Indian counterparts, one from the State Department of Agriculture and one from the Agricultural College and Research Institute (which is a part of the State Department of Agriculture). Each US specialist and his 2 counterparts are known as the Field Problem Unit (FPU) for their particular specialty. The FPU's have made progress in achieving the objectives of the project, i.e., improving coordination between the research and extension groups of the Department of Agriculture, identifying production problems in the field, and initiating research directed at solving those problems. The FPU's have effectively assisted in getting farmers to accept the package of practices and increase the acreage of high yield variety (HYV) crops.  Large increases in the acreage of Hybrid Maize and Ir-8 paddy have been planted.  All State goals for adopting acreages of HYV's were exceeded except for sorghum which the farmers did not accept because of a particularly damaging insect.  Research was initiated to test methods of controlling sorghum and rice insects as well as to determine fertilizer requirements on all crops. Geographic separation of the FPU's and Department of Agriculture headquarters has created some problems in coordination.  Problems of low pay, frequent changes in staff, and non-availability of funds do affect progress.  These problems, however, are universal in India and not peculiar to this project. The traditional unwillingness to do actual work in the field resulted in an intensifed program of rural field demonstrations by the FPU's. This resulted in a rapid increase in the acceptance of HYV's by the farmers and a willingness on the part of field agricultural workers to do work in the field.",Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1968,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,24 Apr 1969,1969-04,,,,,,Demonstration|Farms|Pest control|Insects|SORGHUM|RICE|Maize|Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|Cultivars|Crop yield|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural production,,India,,PD-AAD-104-F1,,,,,False,F|E,,638 KB,PDF,,386,India,,Limited data,008557,USAID.

175574,"Evaluates the agricultural production subproject for the State of Mysore, India, as of 12/31/68.  The activity seeks to institutionalize patterns of cooperation between the State Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for services to the cultivator, the Mysore University of Agricultural Sciences which is responsible for research. After a slow start, activities are moving forward.  5 specialists from the Univ-Tennessee have each been assigned 2 counterparts, one from the Mysore University of Agricultural Sciences and one from the State Department of Agriculture.  Each team constitutes a ""field problem unit"" (FPU) in their particular specialty.  A ""High Level Coordinating Committee"" was established to meet with the FPU's to provide policy and overall coordination. FPU's involvement in state activities has continued to grow. Relationships and coordination among the officials of the State Department of Agriculture and the University are improving.  And to a limited extent, the private sector agencies have been involved in the State agricultural programs.  Although the program is young, progress has been made in developing a coordinated approach to training field agricultural workers in demonstrations which has resulted in an increase in the planting of improved wheat by farmers.  The teams are increasingly involved in training of personnel in improved methods -- training the trainers. Cooperative studies of crop fertilizer requirements have been started.  These involve both the Department of Agriculture and the University, in an attempt to correlate actual field results with the recommendations from soil laboratory tests.",Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1968,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/26/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,24 Apr 1969,1969-04,,,,,,Fertilizers|SOIL FERTILITY|WHEAT|Cultivars|Crop yield|Demonstration|Farms|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural production,,India,,PD-AAD-105-B1,,,,,False,F|E,,571 KB,PDF,,386,India,,Limited data,008557,USAID.

There has been a continued growth of involvement by these FPU's in the work of the State Department of Agriculture.  One FPU has developed an insect surveillance method for a demonstration area; subsequently the method was expanded to give state-wide coverage to make control measures more effective. The Extension Information FPU has instituted an Agricultural Information Council and an Extension Information Executive Committee to coordinate extension information activities, including mass media, farmer bulletins, visual aids, and technical handbooks.  The seed production FPU is developing a program to improve the quantity and quality of seeds available in Bihar.

175537,"Reports on progress of the Louisiana State University (LSU) contract team in Vietnam over the period 1/68-4/69.  LSU has been contracted to supply consultative services to the Government of Vietnam in the reorganization of its judicial system and the revision of its penal code, code of panel procedures, civil code, code of civil and commerical procedure, and its commerical code. The LSU field party has surveyed problem areas (survey attached as exhibit C), proposed an operational plan (exhibit B), and recommended the establishment of a multi-agency judicial reform commission to act as a coordinating body (exhibit D.) The LSU team has found that reform activity in the Vietnam legal community is less organized than orignally envisioned at the time the LSU contract was signed.  The Minister of Justice has been replaced, and responsibility for the entire judicial organization has passed from the Ministry of Justice to the newly established supreme court.  In addition, prompt legislative adoption of a plan for judicial reorganization is unlikely; this tends to undermine the sense of urgency in formulating such a plan.  The war also prevents long-range planning of legal reforms. It is the party chief's impression that the interest of the Vietnamese in the contemplated consultation is, on the whole, very moderate.  Expressions of desire for LSU services appear at times ritualistic and perfunctory.  For example, the Minister of Justice refused to allow the LSU team to review the codes in the process of revision before they were submitted to the assembly for approval. Instead, the minister planned to give the codes to the university as finished products.  LSU, however, successfully pleaded with the president's legal advisor to withhold the codes from the assembly momentarily to permit review. LSU warns that it will not risk embarrassment by going through the motions of costly consultations which are purely cultural exchanges with vietnamese counterparts with no particular responsibility, or official interest, in substantial legal reforms.",Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1968-21 APR 1969,,,"Tate, Donald J.",,31,,Periodic Report,dex14,,,,,,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,7/13/1983 12:00:00 AM,21 Apr 1969,1969-04,,,7/25/1983 12:00:00 AM,,7/13/1983 12:00:00 AM,Legal reform|Limited data,,Vietnam,,PD-AAK-652,,--jh,,,False,F|I|E,,"2,047 KB",PDF,,730,"Vietnam (South), Republic of",,Onsite evaluation,001969,Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College.

INCOMPLETE PLANNING, NEGLIGENCE, AND LACK OF COORDINATION DURING THE PROJECT'S CURRENT PHASE (BEGUN IN 1966) HINDERED IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FOLLOWING 6 AREAS: (1) A PIO/C FOR COMMODITIES DESCRIBED ITEMS TOO GENERALLY TO BE USEFUL FOR PROCUREMENT. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD WAS ADOPTED, BUT ESSENTIAL CONTROL RECORDS ON PROCUREMENT STATUS WERE NOT KEPT.

(3) A FLIGHT INSPECTION CALIBRATION LABORATORY ESTABLISHED 8/2/68 WAS SO THINLY STAFFED WITH RTG PERSONNEL THAT THE ABSENCE OF A SINGLE ONE COULD IMPEDE OPERATIONS.

THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF AN INDIGENOUS TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS AND A/V INDUSTRY BY DEVELOPING THE MARKETS FOR THESE EDUC MATERIALS, I.E., INCREASING THE DEMAND FOR AND DISTRUBUTIONOF THESE MATERIALS. TWO MARKETS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION: THE LIBRARY MARKET AND THE UNIV TEXTBOOK MARKET. AFTER ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES AND UNIV COOP BOOKSTORES VIA PERSONAL CONTACT AND QUESTIONARIES, THE RTAC PLACES ORDERS WITH LATIN AMERICAN TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS INDUSTRIES. AID FUNDING PROVIDES FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF TECHNICAL BOOKS AND MATERIALS TO SOME 1600 LIBRARIES AND THE PROCUREMENT OF THE FIRST ROUND OF TEXTBOOKS FOR THE COOP BOOKSTORES. ASSISTANCE TO THE LIBRARIES IS NOT ONLY TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS BUT ALSO TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL PURCHASE BY THE LIBRARIES AND THEIR CLIENTS. ASSISTANCE TO THE BOOKSTORES IS FOR SIMILAR REASONS. AS THE EXISTENCE OF A COOP BOOKSTORE AT A UNIVERSITY QUALIFIES THE UNIV FOR RTAC ASSISTANCE, LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WILL BE PROMPTED TO ESTABLISH COOP BOOKSTORES. THIS WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SUCH BOOKSTORES, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ABLE TO BUY BOOKS AT THE REDUCED PRICES COOPS ARE ABLE TO CHARGE AND THEREFORE, INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR TEXTBOOKS. THE RTAC PLACED ORDERS FOR THE TEXTBOOKS AND MATERIALS WITH THE INDUSTRY. THE RTAC ALSO IS ESTABLISHING AT LEAST ON A/V MATERIALS (OBTAINED THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH US FIRMS); THE VALUE OF A/V MATERIALS IS DEMONSTRATED, INTEREST IN SUCH MATERIALS IS GENERATED AND HOPEFULLY, LATIN AMERICAN A/V INDUSTRIES WOULD DEVELOP TO MEET A NEW DEMAND. THE RTAC SELECTS INDUSTRIES FOR ORDERS BASED UPON ECONOMY OF PRICE AND THEQUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.

174965,"AS OF 4-1-69. THE PROJECT HAS BEEN HIGHLY SATISFACTORY AND EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS AIMS. A RECENT AUDIT REPORT SHOWED A MINIMUM OF NON-USE, MISUSE, AND WASTAGE OF COMMODITIES; ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE REQUIRED TO RETURN TO FAMILY PLANNING WORK; EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO ACHIEVE GOAL HAVE BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCESSFUL; RESEARCH AND EVALUATION ARE BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN A DIVERSITY OF APPROACHES; AND ADVISORY SERVICES IN GENERAL HAVE ADAPTED EFFECTIVELY TO THE PROJECT. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE NEW EFFORTS WERE THE LARGE NUMBER OF SURGICAL STERILIZATIONS DONE AND THE CREATION OF ANEW CORPS OF PARAMEDICAL PERSONNEL TO ALLEVIATE THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS. RECENT CIVIL UNREST AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FAMILY PLANNING. IT IS BY ITS VERY NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATTACK. FURTHERMORE, THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH PRESIDENT AYUB. THERE WAS SOME DISTRUCTION OF FAMILY PLANNING FACILITIES AND IMPEDIMENT OF MOVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF PERSONNEL.

173721,"AS OF 7/1/69. OVERALL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN HIGHLY SATISFACTORY. FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES WERE ESTABLISHED AT 16 RURAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) CLINICS IN 4/68 AND AT 6 MOH CLINICS IN MANAGUA IN 8/68. AS OF 6/30/69, 28 CLINICS WERE PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES THROUGHOUT NICARAGUA. ABOUT 3,000 WOMEN ARE NOW USING CONTRACEPTIVES. EDUCATIONAL/MOTIVATIONAL SESSIONS WERE CONDUCTED FOR VARIOUS GROUPS IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. THE CENTRAL FAMILY PLANNING ORIENTATION CENTER AT MANAGUA (EST. 1/69) CONDUCTED ORIENTATION IN FAMILY PLANNING TO SUCH PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL GROUPS AS: THE NATL ASSN OF PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS, THE MEDICAL SCHOOL, NATL SCHOOL OF NURSING, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORKERS, PERSONNEL AT THE HOSPITAL EL RETIRO, PERSONNEL OF THE HEALTH CENTERS IN THE NORTHERN AREAS OF NICARAGUA AND AUXILIARY NURSES OF PUMAR. ABOUT 20,000 PERSONS HAVE ATTENDED FAMILY PLANNING EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS. THE PRINICIPAL IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM IS LACK OF ADEQUATELY TRAINED PROFESSIONAL STAFF. OVER 150 PROFESSIONALS AND PARAPROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND CONSTITUTE THE CORE PROGRAM PERSONNEL WITHIN THE MOH AND OTHER AGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE SHORT-TERM (1 TO 2-WEEK) REGIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AT EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA DO NOT PROVIDE IN-DEPTH COVERAGE OF THE FIELD BUT ONLY STOP-GAP TRAINING SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN MOVE FORWARD. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE DOES NOT EXIST ANY PERSON IN NICARAGUA WHO CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A PROFESSIONAL FAMILY PLANNING SPECIALIST. VARIOUS LATIN AMERICAN SEMINARS IN FAMILY PLANNING ADMINISTRATION AND SEX EDUCATION ARE OF SHORT DURATION AND ARE MORE CRAM COURSES THAN ACADEMIC. US LONG-TERM TRAINING IS HAMPERED BY THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT. THE WEAK ADMINISTRATION OF MOH CAUSES PROBLEMS IN PROCURING COMMODITIES AND LOGISTICS WHICH HAS DELAYED THE PROGRAM 6 MONTHS.

174263,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO IMPLEMENT MALARIA ERADICATION PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN, AS OF 4/1/69. COOPERATIVE MALARIA ERADICATION PROGRAM (MEP) WAS UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND USAID. DATES SET FOR MALARIA ERADICATION IN WEST AND EAST PAKISTAN WERE 1974 AND 1975, RESPECTIVELY. US PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ADVISORS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED SICNE 11/62. SIX FULL-TIME ADVISORS ARE PRESENTLY ON-BOARD. IN ADDITION, USAID HAS PROVIDED LOANS FOR US COMMODITIES AND LOCAL CURRENCY SUPPORT. THE MEP BEGAN IN SHEIKHURPURA AND DINAJPUR PROVINCES (3.2 MILLION COMBINED POPULATION) AND NOW COVERS THE ENTIRE NATION (112 MILLION). APPRAISALS OF THE MEP HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR EVERY RUPEE SPENT ON THE PROGRAM, TWO AND ONE-HALF ARE RETURNED THROUGH INCREASED FARM PRODUCTIVITY AND SAVINGS IN COSTS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. PROVISION OF PL480 FUNDS LOCAL COSTS PREVENTED A FINANCIAL CRISIS WITHIN THE MEP. (LOCAL SURVEY SHORTAGES WERE BROUGHT ON BY THE INDO-PAKISTAN CONFLICT.) MALARIA TRANSMISSION IN URBAN AREAS OVER 20,000 WAS NOT ANTICIPATED. HOWEVER, EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH RAINFALL, A DEFECTIVE SEWER DRAINAGE SYSTEM, AND INADEQUATE SURVEILLANCE LED TO SERIOUS OUTBREAKS IN KARACHI. OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDED INCREASED SALARY DEMANDS BY GOP EMPLOYEES, HIGH COST OF LOCALLY-PRODUCED DDT, AND THE GOP INSISTENCE THAT THE MEP PAY CUSTOMS DUTIES AND TAXES ON IMPORTED DDT. AID MADE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION MORE DIFFICULT BY DIFFUSING RESPONSIBILITY AMONG THE HEALTH DIVISION, CAPITOL DEVELOPMENT OFFICES, AND THE US PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. DELAY IN PROVISION OF DDT, SPRAYERS, VEHICLES, AND PARTS RESULTED FROM AN UNWIELDY ADMINSTRATIVE PROCESS AND GOP UNWILLINGNESS TO STOCK SUPPLIES. THERE WAS NO CHIEF MALARIA ADVISOR FROM 1961-1963. IN ADDITION, MD'S ASSIGNED BY THE US NATIONAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL WERE NEITHER EXPERIENCED IN MALARIA CONTROL NOR ORIENTED TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THEIR RECENT REPORT, ""STUDY OF URBAN MALARIA IN KARACHI, WEST PAKISTAN"" WAS UNSATISFACTORY AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ILL-FEELING IN THE GOP.

175675,"Initial Project Appraisal Report of Agriculture Organization Project in East Pakistan assesses implementation of project through 4/15/69. Project designed to develop within the Govt of East Pakistan's (GOEP) Agric Dept a well organized & staffed Agric Extension Service, to improve the ability of the East Pakistan Agric Development Corp to provide essential production inputs, and to develop the technical & operational skills necessary to achieve dietary and food grain self-sufficiency. Food production, after a long period of stagnation, is increasing with self-sufficiency predicted for the mid-1970's.  Project effectiveness is difficult to measure since inputs have been limited to technical advice and participant training; project is rated highly satisfactory and judged to be on schedule despite implementation delays and the shortage of well-trained technical staff. Agric Dept has formed an Agric Extension Directorate & is establishing specialist services at the district level.  The use of irrigation pumps & fertilizer has increased rapidly, though not as fast as the GOEP's unrealistic targets. Foundation seed quality is improving. Production of fruits, vegetables & oil crops are increasing rapidly. Over 200 participants have returned to East Pakistan or are currently undergoing training.  Specialized assistance is further planned in the fields of irrigation, agronomy seed improvement, fresh water fisheries, agriculture information & forestry. Other specialized areas such as plant protection, rice production, and horticulture are in need of tech assistance. Project is currently undergoing revision to provide specialist services staffed by returned participants in lieu of exten adv positions. Project suffers most from a shortage of field staff.  Host government red tape, delays in clearance of participants, & unattractive field working conditions and low pay contribute to dilemma.  It is doubtful whether project could sustain itself without US inputs. USAID proposes termination of project in FY1970 and its replacement by expanded projects in agricultural extension, agric input distribution, and fisheries development.",,,,,Microfiche not available,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,7 Aug 1969,1969-08,,,,,,Crop disease control|RICE|HORTICULTURE|Inland fisheries|Forestry|Varietal research|IRRIGATION|Fertilizers|Participants|Statistical data|Agricultural production|Agricultural inputs|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Agricultural diversification|Project change,,Pakistan,,PD-AAP-805,,,,,False,,,,,,391,Pakistan,,Onsite evaluation|Limited data|Project appraisal report (PAR),008588,USAID.

175705,"Reports on USAID assistance from 9/1/69-9/30/69 to improve municipal administration in Guatemala. There are several clauses in the formal loan agreement to which INFOM (National Municipal Promotion Institute) has raised objections.  The municipal seminars were interrupted by recent flooding. However, responses to them continue to be good and additional seminars are planned for early next year.  ANAM (National Association of Municipalities) has expressed interest in a programmed seminar on municipal finances and is also exploring the possibilities of publishing a monthly newsletter.  The ANAM legal advisor is very interested in municipal problems and is playing a more important role in the Association.  The Peace Corps municipal development program now consists of only two volunteers.  The volunteer in Amatitlan resigned because he felt that there was too little for him to do there.  This is unfortunate because the recent flooding of Amatitlan has created a situation which could be used to make some needed changes in the community.",Evaluation period: 1 SEP 1969-30 SEP 1969,,,"MORISEY, ALEXANDER",Best available copy -- faded type,31,M,Periodic Report,,,,,,,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/29/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,6 Oct 1969,1969-10,,,,,,Vocational training|CIVIL SERVICE|Municipal level|Public administration|Management training|Limited data,,Guatemala,,PD-AAA-888-E1,,,,,True,E,,99 KB,PDF,,520,Guatemala,,Onsite evaluation,008550,USAID.

MAJOR FINDINGS INCLUDE: 1)THE REQUIREMENT THAT 50% OF GOODS SHIPPED FROM THE US BE ON US FLAG VESSELS WAS NOT OBSERVED BY THE BORROWER. HOWEVER, THE PIO/C DID NOT CONTAIN REFERENCE TO THE 50% REQUIREMENT. SINCE PRODUREMENT AND RELATED ACTIONS BY GSA ARE BASED ON THOSE CONTAINED IN THE AUTHORIZATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO STATE SPECIFIC LOAN CONDITIONS REGULATING SHIPMENTS IN THE PIO/C. AS A RESULT OF THE AUDIT, THE AUTHORIZED AGENT WAS NOTIFIED OF LOAN CONDITIONS, A WAIVER WAS ACQUIRED FOR PAST SHIPMENTS,AND NEW SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS WERE ISSUED BASED ON THE LOAN CONDITIONS. 2)THE BORROWER'S QUARTERLY SHIPPING STATEMENTS, AS OF 3/31/69, WERE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED. PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE AUDIT, REVISED QUARTERLY STATEMENTS WERE SUBMITTED AND REVIEWD. 3)PIO/C'S DID NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INSURANCE PROVISIONS OR SHIPPING CONDITIONS STATED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT; AND SINCE POLICIES WERE NOT ON FILE FOR ALL SHIPMENTS, THERE IS DOUBT AS TO WHETHER ALL SHIPMENTS WERE INSURED. ACTION WAS TAKEN TO REQUEST MISSING POLICIES, AND PLACE LOAN CONDITIONS ON INSURANCE COVERAGE. 4)LOAN FUNDS WERE USED TO PAY FOR TRANSPORT COSTS FOR SHIPMENTS CARRIED BY FOREIGN FLAG VESSELS CONTARY TO THE FIRST LOAN SUPPLEMENT LETTER.

175709,"Reports on USAID assistance from 9/1/69-9/30/69 to improve tax administration in Guatemala.  The Tax Administration Reform Commission accepted the recommendation of creating 2 collector positions which will be filled by Nov 1.  USAID will assist the collection effort by providing at least 2 motorcycles.  Also the Commission agreed, at least in principal, to transferring the Administration of the Timbres Tax, as related to sales, from the Directorate General of Rentas (General Tax Office) to the Directorate General of Income Tax.  The US tax advisor & the OAS/IDB advisor are studying the existing administrative procedures of this tax and will assist in designing a new system for its administration once the transfer is effective. The target date is 1/1/70.  The US advisor also spent considerable time with the real property cadastral project personnel.  The filing period for FY 1968-69 ended 9/28 and again the income tax office was able to handle the increased volume of returns with the least amount of inconvenience to the taxpayer.  A decision on the creation of a separate tax court was postponed. The Vice-Minister believes that an increase in clerical personnel for the two existing courts would enable them to conclude more cases.  He has requested a statistical report from the Tribunal de Cuentas in order to verify his opinion.  Collections of ordinary & consigned revenues are attached.

211763,"Grant to the Government of Brazil's National Research Council (CNPq) to assist in upgrading chemistry education and research capabilities at three institutions of higher education:  the Federal University Of Rio De Janeiro, the University of San Paulo, and the Brazilian Center for Research in Chemistry and Physics.  CNPq will contract the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to provide the services of 20 postdoctoral chemistry research fellows, 8 senior research scientists, and a project coordinator to work with postgraduate chemistry studentss at the above institutions. Ten chemistry laboratories will be developed within the three institutions.  The senior NAS research scientists will determine the areas of research most relevant to Brazil's needs, thus dictating the general plan for the laboratories; the NAS research fellows together with their Brazilian counterparts will decide what additional equipment is needed.  (All equipment and supplies will be funded by the Government of Brazil.)  Twenty research projects will be conducted at the laboratories and the findings published by the U.S. researchers and Brazilian postgraduates -- providing research experience to the Brazilian participants while adding to the world's scientific knowledge. The A.I.D. contribution also supports tuition costs for 20 Brazilian research scholars at U.S. universities; candidates for this additional training are selected by the CNPq.  To upgrade the technological level of teaching in the three institutions, the research fellows each devote 12 hours/wk to course instruction at the graduate and undergraduate levels.  Additional funding to Brazil's chemistry and research efforts is provided by the E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. Inc, the Alfred P.

MARGINALE WERE MADE IN SPLENECTOMIZED CALVES BY BLOOD INOCULATION. THE SEVERITY OF INFECTION PRODUCED AT THE TWELFTH PASSAGE LEVEL IN FOUR CALVES WAS COMPARED TO THE INFECTION OCCURRING IN FOUR SIMILAR CALVES AT A SECOND PASSAGE LEVEL. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PARASITEMIAS AND LOWER PACKED CELL VOLUMES OCCURRED IN THE TWELFTH-PASSAGE GROUP, SUGGESTING AN INCREASED VIRULENCE. NO DEATHS OCCURRED AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SECOND-PASSAGE GROUP, WHEREAS ONE OF FOUR DIED IN THE TWELFTH-PASSAGE GROUP. WHEN FACED WITH THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO DEPEND ON PREMUNITION WITH A VIRULENT ORGANISM BY NATURAL MEANS OR TO VACCINATE ALL CALVES WITH AN ATTENUATED ORGANISM, THE CHOICE IS CLEARLY IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER. HOWEVER, A POTENTIAL FOR REVERSION EXISTS, AND IN AREAS OF LOW ANAPLASMOSIS INCIDENCE, THE INTRODUCTION OF EVEN AN ATTENUATED AGENT MIGHT BE HAZARDOUS; THIS MIGHT PRODUCE SERIAL TRANSMISSION.

US-ORDERED COMMODITIES WERE DELAYED UP TO 2 YEARS AND MORE, DUE TO VIETNAM INVOLVEMENT AND THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT/CLOSURE OF THE SUEZ CANAL. GERMAN-ORDERED PARTS WERE UNOBTAINABLE DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF US CARRIERS. ECONOMICALLY-ACQUIRED SURPLUS COMMODITIES WERE OFTEN INOPERABLE DUE TO SPARE PARTS DEFICITS.

175355,"Evaluates performance of Mississippi State Univ on a project to provide technical assistance in seed program/industry planning, implementation and evaluation leading toward a responsible seed production industry.  Evaluation was conducted through a review of project documentation and interviews with project and mission staff. Evaluator participated in MSU training courses conducted on seed processing in Colombia, Ecuador and Honduras.  Stops at seed cleaning plants in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro, Honduras and one under construction in Panama were included in itinerary. Countries visited are directly involved in seed production programs, applying for loans to start programs, constructing new facilities, or training personnel. Evaluator noted that the lack of knowledge about services available from AID/TAB was apparent in every mission visited. Lack of knowledge on current seed research and the varieties being tested for release and distribution at the various country and univ experimental stations was also evident.  Duplicate work was being planned or conducted in similar ecological regions.  Review of AID contracts is seen as not giving enough information concerning current seed research. Mission and host govt personnel were laudatory of the high level of technical personnel furnished under MSU contract and services rendered through follow-up correspondence. Technical specifications, bagging, quality control and an explanation of how these are carried out were of particular interest to missions.

175495,"THIS REPORT IS A PRELIMINARY STUDY FOR THE PROPOSED SOCIO-ECON STUDY OF THE ZONA DA MATA AND THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE PROJECT PROP. IT ASSESSES THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE NORTHEAST BRAZILIAN SUGAR INDUSTRY AND ITS ORGANIZATIONAL GROUP, THE NE SUGAR AGRO-INDUSTRY  (GERAN). PURPOSE OF THE PROJ IS TO ASSIST GERAN IN ITS INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS INDUSTRY & LAND REFORM MEASURES. ON-SITE OBSERVATIONS WERE USED TO FORMULATE THIS ASSESSMENT. A PRIMARY CONCLUSION OF THIS REPORT IS THAT THE STUDIES & DATA WHICH FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE ORIGINAL AID APPROACH TO GERAN & THE PROJ WERE OBSOLETE AND MISLEADING. ANY NEW SECTOR STUDY SHOULD UTILIZE NEW INFO AND SHOULD INCLUDE AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF GERAN. THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE EVAL TEAM CONTRADICT THE MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH THIS PROJ WAS DEVELOPED: 1)THE WORKING & LIVING CONDITIONS OF SUGAR WORKERS,WHILE NOT GOOD,DO SEEM TO VARY WIDELY. IN SOME AREAS,WORKERS ARE ABLE TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN CANE & OTHER CROPS AS A SIDE ACTIVITY. 2)THERE IS SOME QUESTION THAT GERAN UNDERSTANDS THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE COMPANY TOWNS & THE NEEDS OF THE WORKERS WELL ENOUGH TO DESIGN REALISTIC IMPROVEMENTS. THE MUTUAL DISTRUST BETWEEN GERAN & THE RURAL WORKERS' UNIONS FURTHER REDUCES THE POSSIBILITY FOR GERAN EFFECTIVENESS. 3)THE NE SUGAR ECONOMY,PREVIOUSLY JUDGED AS INEFFICIENT,HAS UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT WITHOUT GERAN ASSISTANCE DUE TO THE INCREASING USE OF MODERN CULTIVATION METHODS AND A DEVELOPING SUGAR PROCESSING & HANDLING INFRASTRUCTURE. 4)USING MODERNIZATION HAS NOT LED TO WORKER DISPLACEMENT AS ANTICIPATED. TYING LAND REFORM TO NEW LABOR DISPLACEMENT COULD RESULT IN VERY LITTLE LAND REFORM AND SELECTION OF THE POOREST FARMING PROSPECTS. 5)TRAINING NEEDS OF SUGAR WORKERS MAY BE EXAGGERATED AS ITIS UNKNOWN HOW MANY WORKERS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE GERAN AGRARIAN REFORM PROG. 6)NOT ALL NE SUGAR ENTERPRISES ARE IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY; THOSE THAT ARE WOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY THE GOB AND EITHER SUBDIVIDED FOR SETTLEMENT OR CONSOLIDATED. 7)GERAN IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL AGENCIES INVOLVED WITH THE NE SUGAR INDUSTRY.",Evaluation period: Through 15 Dec 1969,,,"NATHAN, K.|LION, DONOR M.",,51,M,Assessment,,,,,,,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,,3/19/1979 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,15 Dec 1969,1969-12,,,,,,LAND REFORM|Farmer training|Agricultural education|Institution building|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Sugar|Food industry|SUGAR CANE,,Brazil,,PD-AAA-283-B1,,,,,False,F|E,,553 KB,PDF,,512,Brazil,,Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation,,,,,,,English,application/pdf,A59.3|E04.42|A75.93|E08.22|E08|A75|J02.57.M6.M|A72|A73|P03.82|A02.44.M|M02.DF.2E|M04.62|A02.42.F6|G06.2B.8,,1,14,,,,,5120249,512024904,04,22849,,,,,,FROM BREF|Converted to searchable PDF 2010-03-25 (exact OCR),,GERAN : NEED FOR A FRESH LOOK AT SOME BASIC ASSUMPTIONS,,,,,,22849PD-AAA-283-B1,512024904,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PDAAA283B1.pdf,,,,False,EN,,,Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural products~Plant products~Crops~Sugar crops~Sugar cane|Notation~Notation Collection~J~J02~J02.5~J02.57~J02.57.M~J02.57.M6~J02.57.M6.M|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural education|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A02~A02.4~A02.42~A02.42.F~A02.42.F6|Notation~Notation Collection~M~M04~M04.6~M04.62|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural planning|Document Type~Document Type Collection~Technical Reports (all)~Assessment|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural products~Plant products~Plant source foods~Sugar|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural education~Agricultural training~Farmer training|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Industry and technology~Materials~Chemical products~Food additives~Flavor enhancers~Sugar|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Government and law~The state~Government~Public administration~Foreign assistance~Development assistance~Institution building|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A73|Notation~Notation Collection~E~E08~E08.2~E08.22|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A75~A75.9~A75.93|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Management~Management operations~Planning~Agricultural planning|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Education~Agricultural education|Notation~Notation Collection~E~E08|Notation~Notation Collection~G~G06~G06.2~G06.2B~G06.2B.8|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agrarian reform~Land reform|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Education~Training~Agricultural training~Farmer training|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural policy|Notation~Notation Collection~P~P03~P03.8~P03.82|Notation~Notation Collection~M~M02~M02.D~M02.DF~M02.DF.2~M02.DF.2E|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A75|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Geographical areas and countries~America~Latin America~South America~Brazil|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Education~Agricultural education~Agricultural training~Farmer training|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Industry and technology~Industry~Light industries~Food industry|Notation~Notation Collection~E~E04~E04.4~E04.42|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A02~A02.4~A02.44~A02.44.M|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A59~A59.3|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A72,3/19/1979 5:00:00 AM,3/12/2013 11:55:46 AM,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,,,Guest,,,,,,
175549,"REPORTS THE PROGRESS OF THE PLANT AND SEED MATERIALS PROJECT FOR THE PERIOD 1/1/69 THROUGH 12/31/69. PURPOSE OF PROJECT WAS TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION INTO LDCS OF IMPROVED PLANT VARIETIES. THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THIS EVALUATION WAS UNSPECIFIED. RESEARCH CONTINUED ON SEVERAL PLANT VARIETIES INCLUDING TOMATOES, POTATOES, STRAWBERRIES, AND YAMS. YAM RESEARCH WAS ONE PART OF AN EFFORT TO FIND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF HIGHLY NUTRITIONAL ROOT CROPS FOR THE TROPICS. AT THE TIME OF THIS EVALUATION, THE FEDERAL EXPERIMENT STATION AT MAYAGUEZ, PUERTO RICO WAS CONDUCTING YAM RESEARCH IN THE AREAS OF: 1) CURRENT AND IMPROVED CULTURAL PRACTICES WITH THE GREATER YAM, DIOSCOREA ALATA; 2) VARIETAL TRIALS WITH PUERTO RICAN AND INTRODUCED VARIETIES OF D ALATA; 3) PROPAGATION, STORAGE, AND GROWTH OF YAM BULBILS; 4) SYSTEMS OF YAM PRODUCTION; 5) BREEDING SYSTEMS FOR YAMS. A REPORT,""EDIBLE YAMS  (DIOSCOREA SPP.) -- THEIR DISTRIBUTION,CULTURE,AND ECONOMIC VALUE"",WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY. OTHER PUBLICATIONS WHICH RESULTED FROM THIS PROJECT INCLUDE A ""SURVEY OF MOROCCO FOR CEREAL DISEASES AND PESTS"",AND A PAPER DESCRIBING PLANT INTRODUCTION PROCEDURES USED BY THE USDA. A GERM PLASM COLLECTION OF EDIBLE YAMS WAS STARTED AT THE FEDERAL EXPERIMENT STATION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PUERTO RICO AES.

Until termination, AIFLD (American Institute for Free labor Development) assistance should focus on support of the new democratic labor federation and training labor leaders in the fundamentals of modern unionism.  The AIFLD staff has demonstrated a high level of dedication and effectiveness.  The number of those who have or who are currently participating in labor education courses numbers approximately 4,000 -- and should reach 5,000 in the next 3 years. Since its establishment in 1969/1970, the Confederation of Uruguayan Workers (CUT) has grown to 50,000.  CUT has established a dues structure; and is collecting revenues even though they are insufficient to make CUT financially self-sufficient.

BUT THE TREND HAS BEEN ONE OF IMPROVEMENT AND PROJECT IS NOW WELL ORGANIZED AND FUNCTIONING ACCORDING TO EXPECTATIONS. THE PUBLISHING COMPANIES INVOLVED IN TEXTBOOK PRODUCTION OVERESTIMATED THEIR CAPACITY AND PRODUCTION IS BEHIND SCHEDULE. CONTRACTING OF TECHNICAL ADVISORS IS DELAYED BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO LOCATE QUALIFIED TECHNICIANS. LABORATORY PERSONNEL TRAINING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE BECAUSE OF PERSONNEL CHANGES. THE TEXT DISTRIBUTION PLAN IS ALSO BEHIND SCHEDULE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL OTHER DELAYS IN PROJECT DUE TO FREQUENT CHANGE OF MINISTERS OF EDUCATION. THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE LABORATORY INTO THE BOLIVIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD IMPROVE THIS SITUATION. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS ADMINISTERING EDUC IN BOLIVIA WERE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT ENTITIES WITH LITTLE COORDINATION. PROJECT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PRODUCING MORE COOPERATIVE ATTITUDES AMONG INSTITUTIONS. THE GOB HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUPPLY LABORATORY MATERIALS BECAUSE OF AN INADEQUATE BUDGET NOR HAS IT BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES AND MATERIALS RELATED TO THE CURRICULUM LABORATORY. USAID/BOLIVIA DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT AND PROJECT CONTINUES TO BE A VALID ENTERPRISE.

174229,"EVALUATES PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPABILITY OF THE GONDAR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEGE TO TRAIN RURAL HEALTH PERSONNEL, AS OF 6/30/69. THUS FAR, GONDAR HAS GRADUATED 802 STUDENTS -- 199 HEALTH OFFICERS, 253 COMMUNITY NURSES, 28 NURSE-MIDWIVES, 226 SANITARIANS, AND 96 LABORATORY TECHNICIANS. (THE LAST CATEGORY WILL BE DELETED WHEN THE PRESENT STUDENTS ARE GRADUATED.) EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE STAFF IS ETHIOPIAN. THE LOCAL PROVINCE HEALTH FACILITIES NOW INCLUDE 1 HOSPITAL (200 BEDS), 5 TRAINING HEALTH CENTERS, 1 SERVICE HEALTH CENTER, AND 16 ADDITIONAL HEALTH CENTERS. USAID SUPPORT CONSISTED OF KEY PERSONNEL, PARTICIPANT TRAINING, IMPROVEMENT OF THE PHYSICAL PLANT; AND DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PROJECT, A MAJOR PART OF THE COLLEGE'S OPERATING FUNDS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE COLLEGE WILL BE COMPLETELY STAFFED BY ETHIOPIANS BY FY73, AND THAT USAID SUPPORT WILL BE WITHDRAWN AT THAT TIME. MAJOR PROBLEMS HAVE CENTERED ON THE RECRUITMENT OF OPEX STAFF -- SPECIFICALLY, THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COLLEGE PAY TRAVEL COSTS FOR US TECHNICIANS, IN ADDITION TO THE SCARCITY OF QUALIFIED TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. THE MISSION IS CONSIDERING PAYING TRAVEL COSTS. AT ONE POINT, SERIOUS STRAINS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE AMERICAN TECHNICIANS AND THE ETHIOPIAN STAFF. WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ETHOPIAN DEAN IN 8/68, RELATIONSHIPS HAVE IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY. SINCE ENGLISH IS USED IN THE COLLEGE, PARTICIPANT CANDIDATES HAD NO LANGUAGE PROBLEMS. A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP SELECTION COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED, AND HAS IMPOSED A NUMBER OF CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF CANDIDATES. EARLY IN THE PROJECT, THERE WERE LONG DELAYS IN RECEIVING COMMODITIES, AND MAINTENANCE AND SPARE PARTS HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE SITUATION IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE WITH THE RECCENT HIRING OF A QUALIFIED MAINTENANCE EXPERT.

174234,"EVALUATES USAID ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOP DECENTRALIZED BASIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT ETHIOPIA AS OF 11/1/69. WITH THE PHASING OUT OF THE HEALTH EDUCATION ADVISOR POSITION IN 6/68 AND THE NURSING ADVISOR IN 11/68,TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WAS LIMITED TO GENERAL ADVISORY SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISOR. WITH HIS DEPARTURE (12/1/69), AID ASSISTANCE WILL BE LIMITED TO ONE PROVINCIAL MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (OPEX) AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF US TRAINING PARTICIPANTS. A HEALTH DEPT & HOSPITALS WERE ESTABLISHED IN EACH PROVINCE. AT PRESENT,THERE ARE ONLY THREE PROVINCES WITH QUALIFIED MEDICAL LEADERSHIP. THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH (MPH) IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTING 28 HLTH OFFICERS IN THE HSIU  MEDICAL SCHOOL. A TOTAL OF 66 RURAL HEALTH CENTERS (INCLUDING 5 HLTH TRNG CENTERS AT GONDAR,BEGEMIDIR-SEMIEN PROVINCE) ARE FUNCTIONING. FURTHERMORE, THE MPH ASSIGNED TEAMS OF GONDAR-GRADUATED HEALTH WORKERS TO 15 LOCALITIES WHERE IT IS PLANNED TO CONSTRUCT HEALTH CENTERS. APPROXIMATELY 600 HEALTH STATION & CLINIC ARE OPERATING IN ALL PROVINCES OF THE NATION. AN IMPORTANT STEP IN STRENGTHENING THE MPH CENTRAL ORGANIZATION WAS TAKEN THIS FY WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF A SWEDISH PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICIAN TO HEAD A NEW DIVISION OF PROVINCIAL HEALTH SERVICES. A MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT WAS MET WITH THE ESTABLISHEMENT OF FUNCTIONING NURSING & HEALTH EDUCATION SECTIONS IN THE MPH. BOTH SECTIONS ARE NOW STAFFED WITH TRAINED ETHIOPIAN PERSONNEL,MOST OF WHICH ARE RETURNED PARTICIPANTS. IN ANDDITION, A JOINT COMMITTE WAS ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GONDAR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEGE (A BRANCH OF THE HSIU MEDICAL SCHOOL) & THE MPH. WHILE HEALTH SERVICES COVER ONLY ABOUT 15-20% OF ETHIOPIA'S TOTAL POPULATION,THE PROJ CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO IEG PUBLIC HLTH SECTOR PLANS & GOALS. HOWEVER,THE LACK OF A POSITIVE POP-FAMILY PLNNG POLICY HAS POSED A SERIOUS HANDICAP FROM BOTH ECONOMIC & HUMANITARIAN VIEWPOINTS. CONTINUATION OF THE PROJ IS NOT CONSIDERED IN THE INTEREST OF US OBJECTIVES UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT FAMILY PLNNG SERVICES BECOME AN INTEGRATED PART OF THE NATION'S HEALTH SERVICES.",Evaluation period: 23 Apr 1962-1 Nov 1969,,,,,25,M,Other USAID Evaluation,,,,,,,,12/20/1977 12:00:00 AM,,12/20/1977 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM,,1 Dec 1969,1969-12,,,,,,Training centers|Medical education|Health professionals|Building renovation|Health delivery|Health outreach services|Building construction|Technical assistance|Health care administration|Decentralization|Health care|Primary health care|Health facilities|Institution building|Rural areas|Hospitals|Clinics|Health education|Provinces|Health care planning|Government departments,,Ethiopia,,PD-AAB-917-D1,,,,,False,,,,,,663,Ethiopia,,Limited data,008543,USAID.

THE TWO PURPOSES OF THE STUDY WERE TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE THE EXISTING MARKETING SYSTEM AS A BASIS FOR FORMULATING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS, AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE USEFUL CONCEPTUALIZATION OF MARKET PROCESSES IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FIELD RESEARCH INCLUDED 2,350 STRUCTURED, PERSONAL INTERVIEW SURVEYS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS INCLUDING CONSUMERS, RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS, PROCESSORS, ASSEMBLERS, FARMERS, AND MANUFACTURERS OF SELECTED INDUSTRIAL GOODS. SOME OF THE MAJOR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE: 1) MODIFY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS SO THAT A PORTION OF INVESTMENT FUNDS ARE DIRECTED TOWARD MARKETING SYSTEMS FOR MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURAL INPUTS AND LOW-PRICED CONSUMER GOODS. 2) STIMULATE AND REINFORCE THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RECIFE FOOD MARKETING SYSTEM THROUGH A PROGRAM PROVIDING CREDIT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FOOD RETAILERS WITH EMPHASIS ON INCREASING SIZE OF OPERATIONS AND RATIONALIZING THE RELATED WHOLESALING FUNCTIONS. 3) IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN RURAL ASSEMBLY MARKETS BY EXPANDING AND STRENGTHENING THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT PRICE STABILIZATION PROGRAMS FOR STAPLE FOOD CROPS, DEVELOPING A MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM LINKING INTERIOR TRADING CENTERS WITH RECIFE, AND IMPROVING VILLAGE-TO-MARKET CONVERGENCE CENTER ROADS. 4) GIVE HIGH PRIORITY TO A PROGRAM OF ACCELERATED AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH FOR THE TESTING OF NEW CROP VARIETIES, FERTILIZERS, ETC., ALONG WITH A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO FARMERS AND CREDIT FOR INPUT PURCHASES.

156969,"A DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FOOD PRODUCTION-MARKETING SYSTEM AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES. AMONG THE FINDINGS WERE THAT ONE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED REFORMS IS THE CREATION OF LARGER-SCALE RETAILING AND WHOLESALING ESTABLISHMENTS IN LA PAZ. A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MODERN FOOD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS THE APPARENT LACK OF MANAGEMENT TALENT, ESPECIALLY AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE PRICE OF FOOD CAN BE GAINED BY FULL-LINE RETAILING AND WHOLESALING OF ALL FOODS OTHER THAN FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THE KEY TO INCREASED SCALE AND REDUCED PRICES IS THE OFFERING OF THE FOUR STAPLES -- BEEF, BREAD, POTATOES, AND RICE -- THROUGH ONE OUTLET; SEVERAL PRIVATE SECTOR EFFORTS ALREADY ARE SETTING UP LARGE-SCALE, MODERN RETAIL OUTLETS. PROGRESS TOWARD LARGE-SCALE RETAILING AND WHOLESALING OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE LESS RAPID THAN FOR THE FOUR STAPLES.

THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE PUERTO RICAN EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE FEAR OF UNEMPLOYMENT AS A RESULT OF COMMERCIAL REFORMS CAN BE AND PROBABLY MOST ALWAYS IS A STRAW MAN. AS MORE EFFICIENT OPERATORS EMERGED IN PUERTO RICO, TOTAL EMPLOYMENT IN RETAIL FOOD DISTRIBUTION ACTUALLY INCREASED. PUERTO RICO ACCOMPLISHED A THOROUGH-GOING REFORM IN DISTRIBUTION WITH ALMOST NO POLITICAL OPPOSITION, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT APPROACHED THE SUBJECT.

155648,"Health planning is becoming an objective and quantifiable science rather than an intuitive and subjective art acquired from years of administrative experience. This rationalization of the planning process requires new methods of data collection and analysis. Field work in response to this need forms the subject of this paper. In summary, functional analysis methods added to the present measurement skills of the experimental field epidemiologist provide a useful bridge to health services planning and research. We have adapted basic systems analysis and operations research techniques to measure more precisely the combinations of variables relating to service inputs. The household survey is then used to supplement standard output measurements with morbidity and utilization data. The combined field methodology should have much relevance to the health planner who is trying to develop and implement innovative programs.",,,2:4,"Reinke, William A.|Taylor, Carl E.|Parker, R.

181925,"Searching for urgently needed cash crops, smallholders in Uganda's Kigezi District accepted in 1951 a government proposal to produce vegetables of European origin despite unfavorable marketing conditions, according to this study of the program. After a lengthy introductory section on Kigezi's characteristics and history and on the production, marketing, and organizational preconditions for vegetable growing, the establishment of the Kigezi vegetable growing industry and its transformation from a private to a cooperative enterprise is reviewed.  This is followed by descriptions of:  extension, cultivation, yield, and cost aspects of vegetable production; the organization of growers; and present and future marketing prospects.  A final section reviews the program's effects on the Kigezi District as a whole, on the cooperative societies, and on farm returns.  The program's positive results, it is concluded, show that producer interest and dependence on a crop can overcome disadvantageous factors; that the African smallholder can adapt to new situations relatively quickly if he trusts the project; and that cooperatives can, under the right conditions, play an important role in marketing.",Bibliography: p. 214-217,,,"Scherer, Friede","IFO-Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung, Poschingerstrasse 5, 8000|Munich 86, Federal Republic of Germany",54,M,Other USAID Supported Study/Document,,,,,,,,5/25/1984 12:00:00 AM,,4/27/1984 12:00:00 AM,8/2/1985 12:00:00 AM,8/2/1985 12:00:00 AM,5/2/1984 12:00:00 AM,1969,1969,,,5/7/1984 12:00:00 AM,5/16/1984 12:00:00 AM,5/2/1984 12:00:00 AM,Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production|Vegetable crops|Marketing|Cooperatives,,Uganda,,PN-AAP-653,,LB,,,True,F|E,,"4,767 KB",PDF,,617,Uganda,,,003632,IFO-Institute for Economic Research,S,DST/W-540,,,English,application/pdf,A50.23|A41.2|N02.46|A03|A02.42.8|P03.X|P15.K|G03.24.R|G03.5U,,3,235,,"x, 217 p.",,,,,,29286,,,,,,"Farming Systems Research Bibliography, v.1|FSR1|Converted to searchable PDF 2010-08-31 (exact OCR)",AD40,"Development of smallholder vegetable production in Kigezi, Uganda","IFO forschungsberichte der Afrika-studienstelle, no. 23",,,,,29286PN-AAP-653,,D:\Projects\USAID\PDFs\PNAAP653.pdf,,003632 - IFO-Institute for Economic Research,,False,En,Farming systems,,Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural products~Plant products~Crops~Vegetable crops|Notation~Notation Collection~G~G03~G03.2~G03.24~G03.24.R|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural production|Notation~Notation Collection~N~N02~N02.4~N02.46|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A03|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural occupations~Farmers|Notation~Notation Collection~P~P03~P03.X|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Geographical areas and countries~Africa~Africa south of Sahara~East Africa~Uganda|Notation~Notation Collection~G~G03~G03.5~G03.5U|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Labor~Occupations~Agricultural occupations~Farmers|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A02~A02.4~A02.42~A02.42.8|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Management~Management operations~Marketing|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A41~A41.2|Notation~Notation Collection~A~A50~A50.2~A50.23|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Agriculture~Agricultural enterprises~Farms~Small farms|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Geographical areas and countries~Africa~English speaking Africa~Uganda|Document Type~Document Type Collection~Technical Reports (all)~Other USAID Supported Study/Document|Notation~Notation Collection~P~P15~P15.K|Thesaurus~Thesaurus Collection~Management~Organizations~Cooperatives,3/28/1984 5:00:00 AM,6/10/2012 11:41:17 PM,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,,,Guest,,,,,,

212805,"Subproject (SP) to support radio communications between the Government of Thailand (GOT) and the northern hill tribe minorities by expanding use of the Public Relations Department's (PRD) 100-kw transmitter located at Lamphun, near Chiang Mai. The SP's objectives are to reduce the vulnerability of tribal peoples to communist subversionand increase their understanding of GOT programs. The transmitter, which was originally provided by the U.S. Information Agency, is already being used for broadcasts to hill tribes, but is currently on the air for only a few hours each day due to insufficient resources.  Under the SP, the station will be on the air 17 hours per day at full power, with broadcasts in the three tribal languages -- Meo, Yao, and Karen -- and the Northern Thai dialect. Material produced at the studio will be taped and sent to other transmitters in the North, ensuring wide audience coverage. The GOT will hire the following personnel for the PRD:  two supervisors, two writers, six technicians, two maintenance technicians, four four-person teams of announcers (one team for each language) plus four more announcers for program presentation, three news reporters, and clerical and support personnel.  A broadcasting advisor from the Government of Australia will help in training these personnel and providing related TA.  A.I.D. will finance the provision of studio and ancillary equipment, a TA team to install it, and various vehicles.",Project title: Remote area security (Sub-project : hilltribe|broadcasting support),,,,,13,M,Loan/Grant Agreement,,,,,,,,11/9/1990 12:00:00 AM,,9/5/1990 12:00:00 AM,11/12/1990 12:00:00 AM,11/12/1990 12:00:00 AM,9/13/1990 12:00:00 AM,1969,1969,,10/8/1990 12:00:00 AM,10/22/1990 12:00:00 AM,10/22/1990 12:00:00 AM,9/13/1990 12:00:00 AM,Tribal groups|Information dissemination|Persuasive information|Counterinsurgency|Radio communications|Broadcasts,Telecommunications equipment|Transmitters|Technical training|Native languages|Communism,Thailand,,PD-ABB-472,,HS,,,False,F|E,,774 KB,PDF,,493,Thailand,,Counterinsurgency (COIN),008613,USAID.
